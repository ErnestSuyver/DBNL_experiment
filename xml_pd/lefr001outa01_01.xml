<head rend="h3">Advertisement by the Editor.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Courteous</hi> reader! a few years ago I had the honour, with three
more, of leading the forlorn hope in an enterprise of almost desperate
philanthropy in Dutch Guiana. My three companions successively fell
victims to the pestilential climate; I only have survived the deadly
service. Amongst the papers which fell into my hands upon the death of
one of my companions was the manuscript from which the following
pages are printed. On my first inspection I thought it was something of a
private journal of what had happened to himself, but cannot, upon the
most careful inquiry, find a single name of any person at Surinam
corresponding with those mentioned in the narrative, and there is no
such plantation as Anne's Grove in the colony. The rest of the locale
seems to agree with the reality; but whether any thing of allegorical
illustration was intended by the com-
<pb n="VIII"/>
pilation, or whether it is altogether a fiction of my friend's imagination, or
whether (to use a favourite metaphor of the late Lord Ellenborough in
libellifying publications) it consists of only a peg or two of truth whereon
to suspend a profuse drapery of fiction, or a peg or two of fiction
whereon to suspend a respectable drapery of truth, you are just as good
a judge as I am. In either case, whether pure fiction, or only a sort of
melo-fictitious reality, it seemed to me to have sufficient interest to justify
me in offering it to your candid perusal.</p>
<p>For myself, I disclaim all intention of personal offence or reflection in
this publication; my object is merely to expose some of those features in
the <hi rend="i">unreformed</hi> system of West Indian slavery, which I am quite sure
every honest man in Guiana, Dutch or English, infidel or believer, will
agree with me, are at irreconcileable variance with <hi rend="sc">Christianity</hi>. Of
the origin of that system every living being is absolutely guiltless, and
many of them of all blame in the origin of their connexion with it.</p>
<p>I have the honour to subscribe myself,</p>
<p>Courteous Reader,</p>
<p>Your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Edward Bentinck</hi>, a young officer in the Dutch service, was stationed in
the year 1820 with a detachment of his regiment at an outpost on the eastern
extremity of the colony of Surinam, near the mouth of Marawina river. His
father, a Dutch nobleman, who had emigrated from Holland on the expulsion of
the Stadtholder, had obtained from the late Duke of Portland, of whom he was a
distant relation, when that nobleman was at the head of the British Cabinet, the
government of the neighbouring colony of Berbice, which he held for several
years during the time that Dutch 
<pb n="2"/>
Guiana was in the occupation of the British. When he entered upon his
appointment, he had left Edward at Eton with a view to his future service in the
British army; but on the restoration of the Orange family, after the peace of
1814, he naturally preferred that of his native sovereign, from whom therefore
he without difficulty procured a commission for his son. Edward, after having
had the honour of being present at the battle of Waterloo, and personally
sharing in the gallant rescue of his own prince, (who, as it is well known,
having been severely wounded on that glorious occasion, was on the very point
of being surrounded and taken prisoner,) was content for some time with the
enjoyment of his well-earned laurels, and the society of his friends. Having
however embraced the army as his profession, he was anxious to see some
variety of service, and there being no immediate prospect of his active
employment in Europe, he solicited and obtained leave to exchange into a
regiment then stationed in South America, which he joined accordingly in the
summer of the year 1820, and was very shortly after his arrival detached to the
outpost already mentioned, being then in the twenty-fourth year of his age.</p>
<p>No young man ever entered life under stronger or more cheerful, grateful, and
affectionate im-
<pb n="3"/>
pressions of the truth and value of Christianity than Edward Bentinck. His
mother, although a member of the Dutch church, and familiar with the
Calvinistic view of revelation which characterizes that establishment, was a
woman of such superior understanding and fervent charity, that she never could
assent to all the repulsive peculiarities in the opinions of its great founder,
which either acquired grace, consistency, and attraction from her mode of
explaining them, or she confessed at once were beyond her comprehension.
Whenever she was pressed with any inferences that seemed to bear hard upon
the impartiality of the Christian dispensation, she used to say, the impartiality is
as complete as is compatible with the free agency of the intelligent natures to
which it is addressed; every one is as free to accept the restorative provision as
he would have been to stand or fall had he been born in paradise, and had the
nature of the disobedience of our first parents been such as to admit of its
punishment being individual and not collective; if the effects should be partial,
it will be simply because men <hi rend="i">are free</hi> agents, and will not always follow the
light when they see it and know it, but continue in darkness because their deeds
are evil. Every man's own bosom tells him that his moral character with his
maker must de-
<pb n="4"/>
pend upon the inobliquity and disinterestedness of his efforts to obey the will of
God, as far as that will has been revealed to, or can be discovered by him.
Mercy, by the Christian system, is infinite to failing efforts, where the combat
has been manfully embraced; or even to repentant and redeeming efforts after
long neglect, where the efforts are sincere. To deny a free agent the reward of
victory where <hi rend="i">all</hi> combat is persistingly declined, is surely neither inconsistent
with justice or mercy. My only anxious wish, Edward, she used to say, is to see
you a good Christian; I have no other: ‘all else beneath the sun God
knoweth if best bestowed or not, and let His will be done.’</p>
<p>Thus indelibly impressed on the core of his young heart, mingled with
the remembrance of a vigilance for his happiness that never slept, a
patience with his faults that never tired, an affection that not only
forgave, but wept and prayed, and would have welcomed any death for
him - like a name engraved on a young tree deepening with its age and
expanding with its growth, and, what ever storms assailed it, if for a
moment partially obscured, never, whilst life itself remained, to be
erased or obliterated - so deep and dear were the impressions of
Christianity engraved by maternal affection upon the heart of Edward
Bentinck.</p></div><div type="chapter">

  <l>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<hi rend="sc">Campbell</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> only resident planter near Edward's outpost was an Englishman of
the name of Cotton, a man of unbounded wealth and almost equally
unbounded profligacy. He was a widower of eight and forty, with only two
surviving legitimate children, Matilda the eldest a girl of about seventeen,
and Charles a child of about six. His wife, a lady of great natural abilities
and the best English education, had died two years before of a broken
heart, 
<pb n="6"/>
owing to her husband's unbridled and irreclaimable indulgence of his passions,
and the total consequent neglect, more than any express ill treatment into which
she had ultimately fallen, but not before she had completely imparted to her
daughter, all her own accomplishments, especially those of drawing, music, and
the Italian and French tongues, as the old school books used to call them, and
besides making her a very considerable proficient in botany, had pursued with
her a course of varied and extensive reading uninterrupted by many of those
tiresome etiquettes, the attention to which is indispensable, but which are often
a great tax in more crowded societies. So that in point of general information
she would have had nothing to fear from a comparison of her daughter with the
daughter of any English nobleman of the same age. The person of Matilda,
which was at least five feet eight inches, would have been too tall if the height
had not been entirely carried off to the eye by the most perfect symmetry of
form, and a corresponding ease and grace and dignity of every motion; indeed it
was scarcely possible for the eye, as she approached or receded from it, to
analyse the figure as it does when every limb seems to obey a separate act of
volition, and to be caught up in succession like those of an automaton by a
separate set of wheels.
<pb n="7"/>
But whatever Matilda did, wherever she bent her steps, grace seemed by stealth
  to follow and furtively compose her,<note n="*" place="foot"> ‘Illam, quicquid agit, quoquo vestigia flectit,<lb/>
    Componit furtim, subsequiturque decor.’<lb/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<hi rend="sc">Tibullus of Sulpicia</hi>, IV, ii. 7. <lb/><hi rend="i">Note by the Author.</hi></note> so that such was the unity of her progress
whenever she moved, that it seemed rather a change of attitude than a
movement of limbs. Matilda's features were perhaps more open to criticism
than her person; her nose was not exactly what a sculptor would select as a
study, but was in perfect unison with the beautiful contour of her head, and
between sweet lips and good teeth, and eye-lashes that, like the rich foliage that
fringes the edge of her own native and magnificent rivers, (for Matilda was a
Creole,) were designed to give shade and reserve to a full supply of light and
intelligence, which whenever she thoughtfully raised them, her eyes seemed to
flash upon all subjects, was never critically examined. Her hair was lightbrown,
arranged always in the simplest taste, and with scarcely any other art than that
of the most exquisite cleanliness. Her complexion, like that of most other
tropical ladies, was pallid and soft, almost without colour, but not in the least
sickly; her dress exactly like that of a lady of her own rank 
  
<pb n="8"/>
and age in Europe, always in the best taste and almost always without any other
ornament than perhaps a rose in the bosom, or a sprig of orange or some other
simple wild flower, playfully intermixed with the hair.</p>
<p>Some of my readers, perhaps, from the foregoing description of Matilda
Cotton, will think that she did not require the prospect of one hundred
thousand pounds fortune to make her sufficiently attractive, but as such
a combination of interesting circumstances although rare will sometimes
take place, and I cannot accommodate the facts of my story to the
reader's ideas of probability, I am obliged to declare, that so it was. Not
that this prospect ever formed an item in the ingredients of her self-estimation; utterly secluded from all society that could exemplify, like the
<hi rend="i">beau mondes</hi> and <hi rend="i">haut tons</hi> of London and Paris, the voracious demand
for money of rivalships in ostentation and display, she scarcely knew
either the value or extent of her father's riches; the supplies of an
elegant retirement, and of the pursuits and studies of a rational and
cultivated mind, having never failed her, she had never been very
inquisitive into the nature or extent of their source, or induced to
examine its stability. From what she heard others say sometimes, she
had some indefinite notions of 
<pb n="9"/>
her father's wealth, but the effect of it which she had observed upon his own
happiness, and those whose happiness ought to have been as dear to him as his
own, disposed her rather to a superstitious fear of it. Matilda too was a sincere
and earnest Christian; she had seen her mother, to whom she owed every thing,
pine herself to death from the neglect of her husband, and the total alienation of
his affections, from which the influence upon him of a sincere belief in
Christianity, however occasionally overborne, would have saved her; and she
ascribed, to the facilities of self-indulgence which his affluence had afforded
him, his abjuration (for she knew that he made no scruple in general of avowing
his infidelity in revelation, although he had never shocked her by such a
confession) from a faith which could allow him no peace of conscience, whilst
his daily practice was in total variance from both the letter and spirit of its
directions, and gladly would she have relinquished all her interest in his wealth,
for an alteration in her father's principles and practice. Not that Mr. Cotton's
character, although far gone indeed from consistent morality, or even consistent
humanity, was entirely monstrous and without any touch of natural affection
and generosity; on the contrary, he doated on his daughter, and possibly from
some 
<pb n="10"/>
remorse of conscience for his conduct towards her mother, and partly to atone
fur it, he was to her all kindness and delicacy; and with a jealousy of
libertinism, which superficial observation perhaps might call inconsistent, but
which in fact is by no means uncommon in such a character, he would scarcely
allow an equivocal observation to pass unreproved in her company, or an eye
  ‘relaxed to love’ to profane her presence.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> hospitality of countries is generally proportioned to the scantiness
of demands upon it; in British West Indians it has always been
conspicuous, and as few men are without some good quality, or the
semblance of some to conceit themselves upon, and this is a sort of
splendid virtue least incongruous with a sensual life, no man had made it
more his study, or knew better how to practise it, and that gracefully,
than Mr. Cotton. Nor indeed had he been less disposed to it, was it
likely, whilst living at a distance of one hundred and fifty miles from the
port and capital of the colony, and whilst his only white neighbours were
the directors (a class of men for the most part of 
<pb n="12"/>
the lowest and coarsest description) of the adjacent plantations, that a young
man like Edward Bentinck, of superior education and perfectly gentlemanly
manners, with intelligent, prepossessing features, and a good figure of five foot
ten inches, set off by a military carriage, and that air of self-possession which
the abrupt and sudden shifts of demand upon all a man's faculties, as well of
body as of mind, comprised in a life of adventure and danger, can only give,
should not be a welcome accession to his table, to which he was often
accordingly invited; and having no companion at his own solitary meal in his
barracks, the rules of the service requiring only the presence of a single officer
with so small a detachment of men, he became, after a few weeks, not only a
regular guest at Mr. Cotton's table, but almost an inmate in his family, and his
mornings as well as evenings were often spent there.</p>
<p>The reader has perhaps already anticipated an attachment between
Edward and Matilda; but whatever the reader may suppose, it was a
long time before Edward himself could come to any such conclusion. On
his first assumption of his military profession, he had with great
innocence, prudence, and decision, solemnly abjured the worship of the
little blind boy, as utterly incompa-
<pb n="13"/>
tible with the frequent hardships, exiles, and dangers by which alone the
honours of such a profession could be won. Besides, he had seen a good deal of
London society, and been admitted from the rank of his father, Count Bentinck,
into that of the court circle at Brussels and the Hague, and he had triumphantly
withstood the ordeal of masquerades, operas, routs, waltzes, conversaziones,
and all other modern fashionable modes of promoting the influence of the social
powers. He had often seen at these parties objects that could not but excite his
admiration - girls of surpassing beauty adorned with all that art and study could
contrive to increase its captivation - radiant figures like the Dauphiness of
Versailles, as described by Burke when he saw her (as he says) ‘just above
the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began
to move in - glittering like the morning star, full of life, and splendour,
and joy.’ But he had always brought his heart away unwounded, and,
as he would fain have persuaded himself, invulnerable; what therefore
(thought he) can I have to apprehend from the dusky belles of the
equator, or if a solitary English rose should chance to grow in such a
wilderness, what little chance is there that <hi rend="i">I</hi> should ever come across it,
or if I should, I can admire it and pass on as I 
<pb n="14"/>
have done many a score times in England itself, where the rose and the lily
unite their matchless empire of female beauty! So much for the self-knowledge
and resolution upon that subject of four and twenty! The fact was, he had never
withstood any ordeal at all. Nothing can be more unpropitious to any
sentimental influence than the noise, heat, collision, constraint, embarrassment,
and often ill-dissembled mutual antipathies, jealousies, envies, and rivalships of
a fashionable London or Brussels party. The flowers that he had seen by their
number and variety had distracted his interest, and very much disenchanted
each other. No single isolated rose had ever before for so long a time together
engaged his undivided attention. For a little while after his arrival the novelty of
the natural as well as moral scenery by which he was surrounded entirely
absorbed all his reflections: the enormous scale of the landscape, the
interminable sweep of massy wood, the size of some of the trees, the breadth
and beauty of the rivers clothed with wood down to the water's edge - except
where in intervals of cultivation the bright and vivid green of a large plantation
of canes finely contrasted with the dark foliage of the surrounding forest - the
luxuriant growth of the canes themselves shooting up perhaps a dozen feet
<pb n="15"/>
above his head, which made him feel always in walking through them like
Gulliver in the Brobdignagian corn fields - the singular appearance, to an eye
accustomed to the European clothing, of a negro and almost naked slave
population, occasionally intermixed with a tribe or family of the free and
aboriginal Indians, very much of the colour of new mahogany, with their light
fantastic coronals of the beautiful feathers of the red and blue macaws, and their
salempores or long pieces of dark blue calico thrown gracefully over one
shoulder, and across the body like a Roman toga - every thing for a little while
was so strange to him, and so unlike any thing he had seen before, as to render
him quite insensible to his danger from an object of much greater and more
important attraction of a European character, till one day when some slight
indisposition had prevented Matilda from occupying her usual place at dinner,
and in the evening acccompanying his flute (which he played very agreeably,
because with truth and judgment, and without any affectation) with her harp or
piano, a suspicion from the pain he felt that he was not quite in marching order
at a moment's notice came across him, and as he sauntered home by the light of
a full moon, he began to challenge himself a little. Is it not very 
<pb n="16"/>
strange (said he to himself) that whenever that girl is absent when I had
expected the pleasure of her company my heart sinks, and I feel as if my visit
had been exclusively to her; and if I do not look like a fool, I always feel as if I
must do so, I cannot enter with any animation into the subject of conversation -
my mind seems withdrawn by some powerful spell from every thing before me,
yet what can I be to Miss Cotton? Or what (fetching a deep sigh) <hi rend="i">ought</hi> she to
be to me? Surely I am not such a fool as to be in love! however <hi rend="i">cavendo tutus!</hi>
I'll not go to-morrow, I'm resolved, or the next day either, unless I feel myself
quite stout again.</p>
<p>Accordingly the next morning he awoke with all his heroism in full force,
resolved to absent himself from the source of danger, but yet (said he)
her father said she had a headache, it would be brutal after so much
hospitality not to ask how she is to-day; I may as well walk towards
Anne's Grove (the name of Mr. Cotton's plantation) as any where else,
and I dare say I shall meet some of the servants, or perhaps her father
himself, of whom I can inquire; besides I wish to take the exact measure
of that silk cotton tree near the house, which would cover the front of half
a dozen of the first rate London 
<pb n="17"/>
houses, and make the largest British oak look really diminutive by the side of it.</p>
<p>Having executed this prudent intention without any interruption, and put
down the dimensions in his pocket book, (viz.) height, one hundred and
twenty-five feet; extreme projection of the branches each way, between
seventy and eighty feet; diameter of head (say) one hundred and fifty
  feet; girth above the buttresses fifteen feet;<note n="*" place="foot"> This is an actual measurement, the girth appears small in proportion,
    but the branches spring from a low part of the stem, which is supported by
    enormous buttresses exactly like those of a Gothic cathedral, sometimes nearly
    twenty feet high. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author.</hi></note> Edward was just proceeding
towards the house in perfect satisfaction with himself, unconsciously
repeating with great emphasis from Sir Walter Scott's beautiful poem of
Rokeby -</p>
<p></p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>‘The myrtle bids the lover live,</l>
<l>But that Matilda <hi rend="i">will</hi> not give;’</l>
</lg>

<p>when the voice of a young lady, who had approached very near to one
side of the tree whilst he was busy taking the girth of the other, startled
him with ‘Good morning, Mr. Bentinck! is my father with you? I thought
I heard my name pronounced by some one?’</p>


<pb n="18"/>
<p>‘Ye--s, I believe - that is - no! I have not seen him,’ replied
Edward, colouring up to his ears, ‘I was also looking for him to inquire
after the health of Miss Cotton, whom he mentioned yesterday as being
slightly indisposed; but I am better pleased in having this ocular proof of
her amendment.’</p>
<p>‘O,’ said Matilda, whilst a slight tinge of carnation suffused her
marble brow, and improved her soft complexion, ‘'twas merely a slight
headache, but my father insisted on my keeping myself quiet; he is over
anxious about me, indeed, since the death of my mother, (the tears
starting into her eyes, and her voice becoming rather tremulous from an
apparent effort to controul some strong emotion,) although nothing can
repair her loss to me, my father has been too good to me, and is
scarcely satisfied, unless I solicit his indulgence of some new whim or
other at least once or twice a month. You'll dine with us to-day, Mr.
Bentinck, it will really be a charity to my father, who is not fond of
soliloquy, and there are not many subjects of interest with him that I can
enter into?’</p>
<p>‘I am afraid,’ said Edward, ‘it will not be in my power to wait
upon Mr. Cotton to-day; I am already a good deal in arrear with my regi-
<pb n="19"/>
mental returns from the enjoyment of his obliging hospitalities, and I must
return to-day to arrange them.’</p>
<p>‘Well then,’ said Matilda, ‘you must breakfast and spend the
day with us to-morrow; regimental returns have rather a serious sound,
but, to say the truth, I want the help of your taste and pencil a little in the
construction of an alcove which I have obtained my father's permission
to erect upon the sea-shore, it is not above a quarter of a mile from the
house, and we are so protected from the sun by the impenetrable foliage
over our heads, in the walk I have had cut to it through the wood, that it
is cooler than the house even in the middle of the day. I shall beg the
favour of your attending me there to-morrow.’</p>
<p>‘That,’ said Edward, ‘is a challenge that it would be difficult for
any one to refuse; my taste and pencil are already much indebted to the
encouragement of Miss Cotton, and cannot be better employed than in
her service. I shall do myself the honour of presenting myself at Anne's
Grove to-morrow, at the time you appoint, to receive my further
orders;’ and having conducted his companion to the door of her
house, and made his bow with rather a constrained air of formality, he
  returned to his post.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<lg type="poem">
<l>‘For ever fallen! no son of nature now,</l>
<l>With freedom charter'd on his manly brow;</l>
<l>Faint, bleeding, bound, he weeps the night away,</l>
<l>And when the sea wind wafts the dewless day,</l>

</lg>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> symptoms of Edward's complaint were now too unequivocal to
allow him to mistake them, and he returned from his morning excursion
under much greater depression of spirits and derangement of his self-complacency than he had sallied forth; so that, on disencumbering
himself of his heavy European regimentals, which are rather adapted to
the frigid than the torrid zone, he threw himself listlessly across two or
three chairs in a state very little qualified to attend to regimental returns,
when Serjeant Vanderdonder appeared with a bundle of papers for his
examina-
<pb n="21"/>
tion and signature, and the short salute of, ‘the returns, your honour!’</p>
<p>‘O! curse the returns,’ said Edward, ‘what have I to do with
regimental returns? 'Othello's occupation's gone!'’</p>
<p>‘Your honour bid me bring them to you, when you came back from
your walk,’ said the serjeant. ‘But the heat's enough to kill the
devil,’ observed Edward; ‘who can trouble himself about returns
with the thermometer at 95? Leave them, however, I'll look at them this
evening.’ 'Othello's occupation's gone!' sighed Edward again, as
soon as the serjeant had withdrawn. ‘Is marriage then the only cure
for love?’ and a thought of great unworthiness crossed him for a
single moment; but to do him justice, scarcely for a moment. ‘No!’
said he, ‘bubble as it is, in some respects, there <hi rend="i">is</hi> glory in the
reputation wrested from the cannon's mouth, the pride, pomp, and
circumstance of war - the consentaneous estimation of personal
courage by all mankind - the conscious superiority to the basest of all
passions, personal fear - the heart and eye that fail not in the worst
extremity, and only to be acquired by constant exposure to danger, <hi rend="i">are</hi>
worth something; but, if such reputation is only to be won by the sacrifice
of private principle and private honour, my ambition is at an end. What-
<pb n="22"/>
ever be the bias of my heart at this moment, it is so free from every taint of
impurity, that if it is not my duty to pursue it, at least, I am sure that I may
safely leave the issue of it to that particular Providence to revere which I have
always been carefully instructed, and, indeed, my own reason persuades me to
confide; for without this supporting doctrine of a particular Providence, not
only the Christian religion must be a fable, but no other religion can be true.
There can be no moral relationship between man and his Maker, at least no
individual moral responsibility, if individual men are not objects of His
attention and care.’</p>
<p>Having thus, very much to his own satisfaction, settled his accounts
with his own heart, he called in the serjeant to proceed with those of his
regiment, to which, with my reader's permission, I must leave him for a
few hours, whilst we return to his neighbours at Anne's Grove.</p>
<p>No girl could be less forward to think herself an object of particular
interest with any one than Matilda Cotton, for from the absence of all
opportunity of self-comparison, she was totally insensible to the
superiority of her own endowments, mental or personal; but it was not
probable that a companion like Edward Bentinck, the only one that was
qualified since her mother's death to enter into 
<pb n="23"/>
either her amusements or studies, should have an attraction for her; and her
father, a man of observation and great natural acuteness, although not of much
reading perhaps, began to suspect such a possibility.</p>
<p>‘You seem heated, my dear Matilda, why will you walk so fast?’
said he, as she entered the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>‘I was afraid you would be waiting, papa; I have been chatting with
Mr. Bentinck, and engaged him to spend the day with us to-morrow,’
replied Matilda, ‘I know I am but a wretched companion for you, and it
is my duty, when I can, to provide you others.’</p>
<p>‘You have hitherto been always <hi rend="i">dutiful</hi>, my dear,’ said Mr. Cotton,
laying considerable stress upon the last word, ‘and as long as you
continue so, your happiness will be the dearest study of my heart, but do
not call yourself a wretched companion for me, or you will make me
suspect I am an insufficient one for you; your society is the most
delightful that remains to me!’ he continued with a half suppressed
sigh. ‘However, I shall be glad to see Mr. Bentinck to dinner; but all
the morning I am likely to be particularly engaged.’</p>
<p>‘I can find him plenty of employment, papa,’ 
<pb n="24"/>
said Matilda, ‘in correcting my designs for the alcove, or supplying me
with better, as I may never again have the advantage of such
assistance.’</p>
<p>‘So you have been killing two birds I see with one stone,’ said her
father; ‘but’ (observing a slight blush on his daughter's cheeks)
‘as you please, my love! You know I trust you perfectly.’</p>
<p>‘My dear papa,’ said Matilda, after her father had left the room,
‘can any faults of yours affect your claims upon my affection and
gratitude? You are too good to me.’</p>
<p>The next morning when breakfast was over, he apologised to Edward
for committing him for a few hours to the charge of his daughter,
‘who,’ said he playfully, ‘is always plundering me upon some
pretence or other, and has expressed her intention of engaging you this
morning in one of her schemes, so I am afraid I shall come badly off
between you. See what it is, Mr. Bentinck, to have a fanciful daughter!
Well, I suppose I must bear it with the best grace I can, but, Matilda, my
dear, be moderate in the expense of your alcove, as West Indian banks,
in the present day, are not quite as inexhaustible as they were fifty years
ago, although yours, thank God, has hitherto been one of the best.’</p>
<p>‘O yes! I dare say,’ replied Matilda, ‘and 
<pb n="25"/>
when it is finished, if the critical eye of a certain gentleman discover any defect,
and I allege in my defence that I was afraid of the expense, I shall get a good
scolding for my self-denial.’</p>
<p>‘Why, that has happened sometimes, perhaps, I must confess,’
said Mr. Cotton, ‘so I believe, as usual, you must have it all your own
way, for I see I shall save nothing by interfering.</p>

<lg type="poem">
<l>‘Bold is the man, how great so e'er his skill,</l>
<l>Who dares to combat with a woman's will;</l>
<l>For if she will, she will, you may depend on't,</l>
<l>And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't.’</l>
</lg>

<p>‘Mr. Bentinck, au bon revoir; I shall, perhaps, be able to pick up an
acquaintance or two to meet you at dinner.</p>
<p>‘I shall always be happy to be introduced to any of your friends,
sir,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Cotton was gone, and Edward and Matilda had spent
some time in sketching, altering, comparing, and selecting from a variety
of designs for alcoves, and grottoes, and summer-houses in one of the
portfolios of the latter, and she had summoned two of her little female
negro pages (of which she had always half a dozen at least of the
handsomest upon the plantation, more especially attached to her own
person) to follow 
<pb n="26"/>
then, she called upon her companion to attend her to the sea-shore to give her
his opinion of the site where she proposed to erect the alcove.</p>
<p>‘You are attached to this spot, Miss Cotton,’ observed Edward, as
they entered upon their beautiful sylvan walk, completely over-canopied
by an intertexture of foliage, impervious even to the rays of the meridan
sun, but kept perfectly dry and healthy by the constant draught through it
from the sea (to which it formed a vista), of a fresh and scarcely ever
failing breeze, loading itself with, and diffusing over the house as it
approached it, the rich perfume of the orange, the jessamine, and the
tube-rose, profusely intermixed with the cinnamon and other native
aromatic plants on each side and through the whole length of the
avenue, ‘as the embellishments by which your house is surrounded,
almost all of which own the fair hand of their author, sufficiently
manifest?’</p>
<p>‘It is my birth-place,’ replied Matilda, ‘and I have never found it
unhealthy, like most other parts of Guiana, and from the prevalence of
the sea-breeze the heat is much less oppressive on the coast than it is
in the interior. The luxuriance of vegetation here and the inexhaustible
field of botanical research and amusement have great charms 
<pb n="27"/>
for me; there is only one spot in the world for which I would exchange it.’</p>
<p>‘May I ask where that spot is?’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘O, England! England!’ exclaimed Matilda, ‘whose glorious
history is ever to my imagination the first and brightest chapter in that of
the world, whose sons are ever prompt to show their manly bosoms to
the fiercest foe, and her illustrious Senate - the home of liberty, the light
of truth, the lofty guardian of all the highest hopes and interests of the
human species, the only impregnable asylum of persecuted justice,
where, as at the bar of God, I had almost said, kings and subjects,
masters and servants, planters and slaves <hi rend="i">must</hi> take their trial; but it is
not her pre-eminence in arts and arms, in freedom and enterprise, that
excite my admiration so much as the Christian morality and generosity of
her national character; where is the field of general philanthropy which
her courage is not the first to undertake, and her constancy the last to
abandon? But I beg your pardon, Mr. Bentinck, you speak our language
so exactly like a native, that I always forget you are not an Englishman.
You must excuse me; I have acquired a habit of being, perhaps, too
warm in defence of England, from the pain I am here frequently exposed
to of hearing it decried; for your countrymen, 
<pb n="28"/>
I am afraid are not very fond of it, and my father is quite a Citizen of the World,
but the name of England uttered with the deepest affection, was mingled with
my last blessing from my mother's lips.’</p>
<p>‘I assure you, Miss Cotton,’ said Edward, (unconsciously
returning a deep sigh to that with which Matilda had concluded her
panegyric,) ‘your animation in defence of England requires no apology
to me, although a foreigner. Any country whose institutions are such as
to occasion an attachment like yours to predominate in the breasts of
her children must be ever great and glorious; besides, I am not at all
insensible to the advantages of your institutions, and consequently of
the English character in many points, over those of other countries.
Indeed I have often wished myself an Englishman, and never more so
(continued Edward, looking earnestly at Matilda,) than since my
introduction to the family at Anne's Grove.’</p>
<p>‘O,’ said Matilda, with a slight blush, ‘I did not mean to tax your
politeness so far as that, Mr. Bentinck; your own country is entitled to
your preference.’</p>
<p>‘My own country is not what I have understood it was,’ said
Edward; ‘it has never recovered the leaven of atheistical principles
which it 
<pb n="29"/>
received when it was overrun and so long occupied by the patricidal armies of
the French revolution. Away from home, the character of my countrymen has
always been rather ferocious, mercenary, and cruel, as the history of Brazil and
the Molucca islands illustrate; but formerly, after their glorious emancipation
from the yoke of Spain, they had at home some great redeeming qualities,
indefatigable industry, a determined spirit of independence, and a stern
simplicity of character. This resulted in part from the gloom of Calvinistic
impressions of Christianity, but which conduced upon the whole to their
maintaining the dignity of their Christian calling, by a strict and exemplary
adherence to, and discharge of, their moral and domestic duties and affections;
but now those that retain any faith in revelation at all, are for the most part
philosophical Socinians, and the mass of the people seem to me decidedly
materialists; which makes their industry sordid, their courage stubbornness, and
their simplicity coarseness.’</p>
<p>‘I cannot say that your picture of the modern Dutch is very
captivating,’ said Matilda; ‘but if materialism is one of their national
features, it will account for any degeneracy - a process of such unlimited
degradation of the human character, that a people must already be
degraded to employ 
<pb n="30"/>
it, as if instead of refining ore into pure gold they should take pleasure in
reconfusing the precious metal into ore. From what I see of your countrymen
settled here, I confess to you fairly I should not call your picture much
overcoloured; but I do not allow myself to think that people of the
miscellaneous character and often desperate fortunes of colonial settlers, are a
fair specimen of the society of the mother country.’</p>
<p>At the end of the walk next the sea, where Edward and Matilda soon
arrived, was a little circular artificial mound or platform, with almond
trees all round the edge, the stems of which were quite clear, like so
many columns, and their intervals open, but the heads were trained to
grow at right angles with the stems, and so interspliced and drawn
together as to form a screen from the sun exactly like the sounding-board of a pulpit - a termination to the avenue rather curious and formal
than beautiful, which suggested to Matilda the substitution of an alcove.
Mr. Bentinck's task was to assist her in contriving one that should form
in itself an interesting object of repose to the eye in looking down the
vista from the house, without intercepting the view of the sea. They had
been sitting for some time upon the benches under the almond trees in
close consultation upon this per-
<pb n="31"/>
plexity, when before they had satisfactorily overcome it, their attention was
diverted to a gallows looking vessel as the sailors call it, (that is, a vessel made
for evading pursuit, as if she were designed for some illegal employment, with
low flat sides, strait gunwale, and masts sloping very much back), and which by
standing off and on the coast, making and answering signals, seemed to be in
communication with some one from the shore.</p>
<p>‘That vessel is after no good I am afraid,’ said Edward, ‘her
appearance and conduct look very suspicious.’</p>
<p>‘O,’ said Matilda, after looking at her attentively for a few
seconds, ‘you will be too familiar with vessels of that description if you
are quartered much longer in this neighbourhood; it's a slave ship, I
cannot bear the sight myself, but if you will just walk round that point of
land a hundred yards lower down, you will see that they'll run in
presently to the mouth of the creek, and discharge their miserable cargo,
where I dare say there are boats ready to receive them.’</p>
<p>‘I was in hopes that this scandal of the Christian world had been
almost extinguished,’ said Edward, ‘is not the importation of
Africans illegal by your laws, and is there not a court here 
<pb n="32"/>
under an express treaty composed of British and Dutch commissioners for its
repression?’</p>
<p>‘The commissioners I am informed,’ said Matilda, ‘have only
authority to interfere with vessels that are caught in the trade under
British or Dutch colours, by a Dutch or British ship of war, and therefore
the British or Dutch colours are of course never or scarcely ever used in
such a business, that vessel you see is under French colours, which are
not subject to visitation by the British cruisers, and the persons here who
ought to enforce the laws of your country for the abolition of the trade,
are almost all of then directly or indirectly concerned in its
encouragement.’</p>
<p>‘But is not your father,’ said Edward, ‘as a British subject
exposed to the penalties of the British abolition laws, which are very
severe, and extend I believe even to death?’</p>
<p>‘Not here,’ said Matilda ‘and if the British commissioners
should report him to their government, it would be difficult in England to
collect the evidence against him; indeed the authorities here would not
give up a British subject to the vengeance of his own country, unless he
were actually engaged and found on board a slave ship, brought by a
British or Dutch cruiser before the mixed Court, which in that case I
understand has authority 
<pb n="33"/>
to send him home for, trial, but not otherwise. I do not know that my father is
concerned at all in the present vessel, but if he is, it is probably only in common
with his neighbours, and there is no one but the captain of the slave ship
himself that could prove which was the original importer; in a few hours these
slaves will be divided perhaps between a dozen plantations.’</p>
<p>‘Might not the government seize them,’ said Edward, before their
dispersion, and punish the owner of the plantations where they were
found?’</p>
<p>‘Their intelligence in Paramaribo, one hundred and fifty miles off,’
said Matilda, ‘could not be quick enough, and if it was, the seizure of
the slaves would not necessarily implicate the planter, as they might be
landed without his knowledge; they might, to be sure, order you or
whoever was the officer stationed at your outpost to interrupt such
proceedings, but we know that they would rather forbid you. In short,
they connive at it as much as possible, they will never act upon
information if they receive any, unless they are goaded and urged to it
by the British commissioners, much less lay themselves out for it; and if
they should be forced to prosecute any one under your abolition laws,
exculpation is easy where there is great reluctance to condemn, and
what between the intimidation of 
<pb n="34"/>
witnesses, the simulation of ships' papers, and the conscious infringement of
the laws by the judges themselves, the worst consequence probably would be a
short confinement. I am therefore under little apprehension of personal danger
to my father: but the enormous guilt and all-crime-comprising character of the
trade is the great drawback on my happiness. I have no doubt that a third of the
original number of that cargo of despair have died on the passage from Africa,
and at least another third of those that remain will not survive their voyage a
twelvemonth. It is, as you may suppose, a forbidden subject between my father
and me, but there is a sort of implied compact between us, that he is not to
interfere with my management of his slaves, if I do not inquire much into his,
and I cannot better employ his indulgence than by endeavouring to alleviate
their sufferings, and make them if possible some reparation for the wrongs, to
the infliction of which he is a party. At my earnest entreaty he has lately
allowed me a Moravian missionary to instruct them on the Sundays, in the
apostolical simplicity of whose character and prudence, and inofficiousness of
whose conduct, my father (to do him justice) always expresses the utmost
confidence.’</p>
<p>‘With such an advocate and benefactress,’ said 
<pb n="35"/>
Edward, ‘upon every plantation, the slaves might find some freeman
who would not be unwilling to change places with them, the transition
from the hold of a slave ship to the ministration of angels, must be like a
translation to heaven.’</p>
<p>‘I am afraid you think me fishing for compliments,’ said Matilda,
‘by your readiness to bestow them; but go,’ said she, and bring me
word when they have landed their miserable captives, that's a spectacle
that will soon sober your fancy, as in case any of them should be taken
to Anne's Grove, I must hasten home to make some addition to my
father's provision for them, but I will wait your return.’</p>
<p>I need not remind such of my readers as are familiar with the models of
ancient sculpture, that the expression of figure is often quite as definite
as that of feature. Constraint, freedom, authority, subjection, boldness,
fear, strength, weakness, exertion, repose, hilarity, dejection, attention,
listlessness, and many other moods of mind, may be conveyed distinctly
to the imagination by attitude and position of muscle alone. When
Edward had run round the point of land before mentioned, he saw some
sailors assembling on the beach, a little farther down between two or
three hundred slaves, some of whom were in pretty good flesh, others 
<pb n="36"/>
nearly skeletons, but one figure, different from the others, arrested his particular
attention, he did not obey the sailors who were marshalling them as quickly as
the rest, he did not move either lamely or alertly like the others, but deliberately
and firmly although with evident reluctance; when he came in contact with the
others, he started out of it again as if he declined their fellowship, his chest was
alternately compressed and dilated, and almost convulsed from indignation or
some strong emotion. There was no stoop in his shoulders, his stature was
perfectly erect, his knees and ancles and all his limbs were beautifully clean and
elastic, his muscles had evidently none of them been unequally strained, his
whole appearance, in short, denoted a man who had never had any other master
than his own will; his wrists were bound together by a strong hand-cuff, with an
iron bar of nearly a foot in length and an inch in diameter between the loops.
When the rest of the party were arranged, one of the sailors, a very strong
robust fellow, seemed to order him to move, and on his expressing or betraying
some hesitation, had the temerity to strike him with great violence, as he stood
fronting him, close under his face, in a single instant the captive raised his
hands, and bringing down the iron bar with the force of both his arms upon the
sailor's 
<pb n="37"/>
head, who dropt instantly as if he had been shot, by one brave bound of nearly
twenty feet, he sprang into the wood, followed however as instantly by half a
dozen sailors with cutlasses and pistols.</p>
<p>When Edward Bentinck returned to Miss Cotton, a little sobered in his
view of the angelic nature of slavery under <hi rend="i">any</hi> circumstances, and told
her what he had seen, ‘God speed him!’ said Matilda, ‘but he
has no chance, their cutlasses will cut down the underwood which will
effectually impede him, especially as he is manacled; but we shall
perhaps hear the result of his attempt to escape, this evening, as I think
it very likely you will meet the captain of the vessel at dinner, at any rate
we must defer our deliberations on the alcove to a better opportunity, as
I wish to get home in case any of his poor fellow victims should have
occasion for my services.’</p>
<p>‘Are labouring hands then so scarce here,’ said Edward, ‘that
men of established wealth and information like your father, will risk their
character, as well as personal peace and security, by so disreputable a
practice?’</p>
<p>‘O no!’ said Matilda, ‘there are more slaves in the colony, I am
sorry to say, than many of their owners can afford properly to clothe and
feed; with regard to my father, I believe it is more
<pb n="38"/>
out of resentment to the interference of the British government than any thing
else, that he continues it; but he is like other planters, too much accustomed to
the almost absolute disposal of the lives of his dependents, and they will never
any of them forgive the invasion of their despotism.’</p>
<p>Conversing in this way, they had not got above half the length of the
avenue on their return to the house, when they were startled by a hoarse
voice of some one concealed by the bushes on one side of them, but
very near, exclaiming ‘D--n you, shoot him!’ when three or four
bullets whistled by them, and in the same instant the noble savage
darted into the avenue, and threw himself covered with blood at their
feet, crying, ‘Save me, massa! save me from those devils! me be your
slave, massa! me give my life for you.’ Matilda fainted, and sunk in
the arms of her companion, her little pages, to whom she was more than
a mother, cried and sobbed, and wrung their hands, saying, ‘Missy
gone dead, Missy gone dead!’ ‘To the house for a couple of men
and a hammock,’ said Edward to one of the little girls, ‘quick
Lucy!’ and in the meantime kneeling on one knee, and supporting
Matilda on the other, and taking off her bonnet and using it as a fan, he
soon removed the syncope, but it was not possible for him to give any
effectual
<pb n="39"/>
assistance to his sable supplicant, against half a dozen men of his own strength,
although the imploring gestures and tone of voice of the unhappy victim were
as pathetic to him, as they were proud, scornful, and indignant to his pursuers,
all he could do as they bound and dragged him off was, to say, ‘remember
that you have been seen, and if you use him illegally it is at your
peril.’ ‘Ay! ay!’ said one of the scoundrels, whose name he
afterwards found to be William Askens.</p>
<p>‘We don't want none of your instructions, we know'se what's legal as
well as you and what is not, and if we did not we shouldn't come to you
to inquire.’</p>
<p>‘Very well!’ said Edward, ‘but depend upon it I shall make some
inquiries about you.’</p>
<p>Whether any of the men knew Miss Cotton, or suspected from some
parts of Edward's dress and military figure, although out of uniform, that
he was the officer commanding the detachment on that station, they
seemed to abate something of their violence with their prisoner, and he
thought he heard one of them say to Askens, ‘hush Bill, the least said
the soonest mended, you're always so d--d ready with your tongue, that
ere gentleman has got the guard down here, its my opinion, and you
know'se very well that this here trade as they
<pb n="40"/>
call's it is out of all law and gospel too, and if I don't wash my hands of all
consarn in it afore long my name's not Bob Jackson.’</p>
<p>The arrival of the hammock prevented Edward's distinguishing any
more of their dialogue, and having carefully conveyed his fair patient to
her house, he repaired to his barracks to shift his clothes and collect
  himself a little before dinner.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<p><hi rend="sc">Besides</hi> Mr. Cotton and one of his blank officers (as they are called) or
directors of the name of Hogshead (a dreadful looking mixture of'
gluttony, remorseless cruelty and craft) and Mr. Bentinck, the dinner-party at Anne's Grove consisted only of two others, one of them was a
man about forty, of light figure and complexion, soft eyes, expressive
rather of good nature, and a <hi rend="i">vive-la-bagatelle</hi> disposition, with a little
something perhaps of treachery and sudden fire, and some irony in the
lines about the mouth, but no expression of deliberate cruelty or indeed
of any prevailing direction of sentiment; there was nothing particularly
coarse even about his hands, which were not quite like those of a
dandy, neither were they
<pb n="42"/>
like those of a clown, but like those of a merchant, or man of business, or any
other plain man. The expression of the other's countenance was one of fixed
and irreversible solemnity and circumspection, it was lighted sometimes by a
smile of great benevolence, but there seemed to be an incapacity to laugh, not
an abstraction from external or near objects, but a concurrent and paramount
attention to some introspective or distant ones; like that of a general whose
commanding elevation enables him to see the movements of approaching or
cooperating forces, that are quite invisible or indistinct to others, an intimate
and sleepless apprehension of surrounding danger, with an expression of
resolved and calm self-devotion to the service in which he was engaged, a
complete supercession of passion, pride and egotism by the overbearing
importance of some more comprehensive interests, and the severe responsibility
of their defence. His eye was one of steady fire without the blaze,</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>‘There was no worldly feeling in his eye,</l>
<l>The world to him was as a thing gone by -’</l>
</lg>
<p>gone by, that is, not as a field of duty but a source of reward; - in the
world but not of it, like Moses on Mount Nebo, he seemed distressed for
want of adequate power to communicate to all his species
<pb n="43"/>
his own glorious view, and their danger if they delayed to follow him, of being
rapidly overtaken by some intervening enemy, that would cut them off from it
for ever.</p>
<p>‘I suppose,’ thought Edward Bentinck, as he prepared to return to
Anne's Grove, ‘I need not be very particular in my dress to-day; Miss
Cotton, I am afraid, will not have recovered her fright, and if she has, her
father will scarcely allow her to be present with this slave captain whom
she hinted I should meet, some farouche looking ruffian, who doesn't
waste much time upon his toilette I'll be bound.’ When therefore on
his joining the party Mr. Cotton introduced him to his two visitors; ‘Mr.
Bentinck! Mr. Schwartz! Captain Légere!’ he was a little surprised to
see in the former an almost saintly benevolence of countenance, and
the dress and appearance of a Moravian missionary, and in the latter
nothing more than an ordinary Frenchman. Still there was so much
singularity and novelty to him in the incongruity of characters assembled,
that he could not help feeling considerable curiosity to see how they
would amalgamate in conversation. The first subject naturally was the
occurrence of the morning, ‘I hope, sir,’ said Edward Bentinck
addressing himself to Mr. Cotton, ‘that Miss Cotton will not suffer
materially from
<pb n="44"/>
her fright this morning, with which doubtless she has acquainted you?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said her father, ‘she is now tolerably composed again,
and will perhaps make her appearance with the coffee, especially as my
friend Mr. Schwartz here is I know one of her particular beaus; but it was
a most outrageous conduct on the part of the seamen, I have requested
Captain Légere to rebuke them severely, and if he gives them a round
dozen it will be scarcely more than they deserve.’</p>
<p>‘Surely,’ said Edward, ‘if the unhappy man dies they'll be guilty
of murder, will they not?’</p>
<p>‘By all the laws of Christendom,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<p>‘O! you mistake me,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘what I complain of, is
their shooting at random in that way through a thin screen of foliage into
an open walk close to a dwelling house; as for the man, if he would not
stop when they desired him, and they could not otherwise overtake him,
I don't see what else they could do very well.’</p>
<p>‘He could hardly expect,’ said Mr. Légere with a sardonic grin,
‘after taking the trouble of bringing him across the Atlantic Ocean into
the rational and civilized world here, that he was to give us the slip in
that way, before he had paid us
<pb n="45"/>
for his passage; but,’ added he, ‘I will take care to rate them soundly
for their want of caution. <hi rend="i">Sacre! ils ne peuvent jamais discriminer</hi> -
they're so accustomed in Africa to use their fuzils, as they would in a
German shooting match, that they keep me in constant hot water
whenever they are on shore any where else.’</p>
<p>‘You give one an encouraging idea of your employment, Mr.
Légere,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘<hi rend="i">Il faut que tout le monde vive,</hi>’ said Légere, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>
<p>‘There are different modes of conducting all employments,’ said
Mr. Cotton, ‘Captain Légere, for example, never stows above three
  mules
  <note n="*" place="foot"> The slang term for slaves. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author</hi>.</note> to a ton, or loses more than a third of his cargo on the voyage,
and his decks are as clean nearly as those of a man of war. I will not
however deny, that it would be desirable to avoid even such a waste of
valuable life and muscle as that, but the risk and penalties are now so
heavy as to compel the traders, like smugglers, to make the profits of
one successful voyage cover the loss and expences of three, and if that
precious little humbug, Mr. Wilberforce, had been content to regulate
instead of abolishing the trade, there might have been something to be
said for him.’</p>

<pb n="46"/>
<p>‘But,’ said Edward, ‘don't you see that it would have been
impossible by any regulations to bring such a trade within the pale of
humanity, because any restrictions that at all proportioned the numbers
to the tonnage of the vessels employed, would have so enhanced the
price of legally imported slaves, as to make the profits upon smuggling a
sufficient temptation to practise it with at least as much, if not more,
disregard to waste of life than prevails at present?’</p>
<p>‘I can't see,’ said Mr. Hogshead, ‘what right Mr. Wilberforce
had to trouble his head about the matter for my part, with Ireland and the
press gang under his nose.’</p>
<p>‘It's rather hard upon Mr. Wilberforce too,’ said Edward, ‘or
indeed any man, to condemn him for doing any thing because he could
not do every thing. What he has achieved has cost him the labour of his
whole life; and looked at seriously, and in all its remote and probable
consequences, a most glorious achievement it is; he has rescued the
profession of Christianity from its foulest blot, and by his single moral
pertinacity, with the divine authority of revelation in his support, he has
done more towards the recognition of the rational rights of man than the
whole infidel sect of the Illuminati, and all the
<pb n="47"/>
physical force employed in the French revolution to boot.’</p>
<p>‘I confess,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘if you appeal to Christianity, the
West Indian case has not a leg to stand upon, if Mr. Schwartz therefore
will not allow me to dispute the truth of that, I throw up my brief.’</p>
<p>‘And if I thought,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘that Christianity was not
true, I confess candidly I should be disposed to throw up mine; my
charge against the system of slavery, as it has hitherto prevailed in the
West Indies, is that it is incompatible with the inculcation of the doctrines
and duties of Christianity upon eight hundred thousand or a million
souls, if those doctrines and duties are of fabulous origin, of course my
charge drops to the ground; otherwise, for instance, how painful, and in
general I'm sorry to say, how vain is it for me to call upon the slaves to
abstain from promiscuous intercourse upon pain of incurring the heavy
displeasure of their Maker, whilst not only is no facility given, but every
possible obstacle opposed to their contraction of marriage, the great
hinge upon which all the charities of life, and consequently all advances
in civilization and moral refinement depend; and the most frightful
example is set them by the whites of contempt for that
<pb n="48"/>
institution; and if I do succeed in impressing the minds of the slaves with a
sense of the truth and obligations of Christianity, how can I do so without
proportionally lessening their respect for their masters, who live in open
derision and defiance of all its restraints, and the spirit as well as letter of its
directions?’</p>
<p>‘To be sure you can't,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘therefore I say an
acquaintance with Christianity cannot be extensively introduced amongst
the slaves without the greatest danger. I have given way to my
daughter's importunity upon the subject, but depend upon it without a
reform of the whole social system (as it exists in this colony at least)
upon Christian principles, to expect you to teach Christianity without
impairing our security, is to expect you to light a candle in a magazine of
powder or gas without danger of explosion.’</p>
<p>‘It is difficult,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘to deny that there is danger,
but the danger, remember, does not result from the nature of the light,
but of the element into which it is introduced, and if there were any
assimilated principles or institutions in general observance amongst the
planters to act like a safety lamp in a mine and prevent the directness of
the contact, the danger would be
<pb n="49"/>
little or none. Nor is it from Christianity (which expressly forbids all violence)
that any danger can fairly be said to result after all, that is, no danger can ever
attend the diffusion of Christianity that is not common to the diffusion of
general information and intelligence; or rather, I should say, whatever is
<hi rend="i">peculiarly Christian</hi> in the light circulated, has nothing in it but humility,
temperance, industry, docility, gentleness, peace, charity, self-sacrifice, and
social love; but the same light by which I inculcate these duties, must also
convey a variety of other truths, philosophical as well as moral, and who can
say that impetuous spirits will not sometimes act upon the light and reject the
discipline?’</p>
<p>‘That Christianity has a levelling tendency in one sense,’ said
Edward, ‘I should think it would be impossible to deny; but its great
value is, that whatever alteration in the condition of the world it is
designed <hi rend="i">ultimately</hi> to accomplish, it is emphatically a religion of
<hi rend="i">tendencies</hi>, while it instructs its disciples to wash each other's feet, to
disclaim all titles of inflation or inequality, and shows that no
condescension which they can practise towards each other can
approach the example of their benignant and divine Master himself in
His mystical incarnation and atonement; it strictly
<pb n="50"/>
forbids the violent employment of the physical force of a little finger in
advancement even of its own designs; so that it seems to comprise the only
means that were ever offered of effecting what has been considered as a
desideratum by the best and wisest of all ages, (viz. a reduction of the great
inequalities in the conditions of men,) without the confusion, and anarchy, and
bloodshed that have always attended and defeated the employment of all
others.’</p>
<p>The reader who has never lived within six degrees of the equator, might
perhaps wish that I should give him some description of an equatorial
dinner, as well as the general conversation that prevailed there, but the
truth is, that except perhaps in rather a greater profusion, although a
general inferiority of materials, there is so little difference either in the
  composition or serving up of the dinner<note n="*" place="foot">The flesh, fish, and fowl of Surinam are all inferior to those of London,

costume of the company, from the dinner of any opulent man in Europe,
that if it were not for the heat of the atmosphere, any one might suppose
himself dining with a London family who kept
<pb n="51"/>
half a dozen black servants. The only peculiarity in a house where there are
  ladies is the naked feet,<note n="*" place="foot"> By a colonial regulation at Surinam, the slaves are prohibited from
    wearing shoes. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author</hi>.</note> which is a little repulsive at first, but after a few
weeks residence, no one would either observe it, or feel the least inconvenience
from it. Upon the plantations sometimes, indeed, and even in Paramaribo, in the
houses of the Jews and low Dutch, the nudity is not confined to the feet, but you
are waited upon by boys and girls of eight and ten years old as naked as they
were born; but my reader need not be informed that in any family presided over
by a <hi rend="i">lady</hi> in the European sense of that term, (although I am sorry to say that
ladies of that description in Dutch Guiana are not very numerous; one great
source of social evil in the West Indies, as in Ireland, being absenteeship,) this
is not and cannot be the case.</p>
<p>Adjoining the room at Anne's Grove, whore Mr. Cotton had ordered tea
and coffee to be prepared, was a long gallery or balcony into which it
opened, this latter again terminating in a door of painted and plate glass,
which opened into two long parallel walks formed by three unusually fine
and lofty rows of the elegant leafed tamarind trees, and resembling with
great accuracy the double aisle 
<pb n="52"/>
of a Gothic cathedral. Having thrown her bonnet loosely over her head to be
ready for the wing on the least alarm of foot-steps, and that volume which every
heart of human mould endears, into her lap, Matilda Cotton had been sitting
here sometime waiting for a message from her father to make tea; but the
moment she heard the approach of one of the party from the dining-room, off
she was like a shot. Unfortunately Mr. Bentinck, who was first in the procession
from the dinner table, saw her before she left her chair, and her father just
caught a glimpse of her fine form as she sprang into the tamarind walk from the
balcony. ‘Matilda, my dear Matilda!’ said her father, following her,
‘give us some tea!’</p>
<p>‘Pray excuse me to-night, papa!’ said Matilda, as she came
running gently back to him when she heard his voice, ‘after what
happened this morning I cannot bear the sight of that odious
Frenchman.’</p>
<p>‘My dear Matilda,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘if by word or look that
odious Frenchman, as you call him, ever insults you, no consequences
of his resentment to myself should save him from my horsewhip; but you
know that as I am completely in his power, it's as well not to offend
him.’</p>
<pb n="53"/>
<p>‘But if I go back, papa! I shall very likely say something that will -’</p>
<p>‘No! no! my love,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘he knows your opinions
very well, and will not be near so likely to take offence at any thing you
say as at your absence - besides, there's your friend Mr. Schwartz there,
and it's hard if we can't keep this Frenchman in order between us; he is,
like many others of his countrymen, half monkey, half tiger, but he will
certainly never display either of these qualities offensively in my
presence to you, and it cannot contaminate you to sit in the same room
with him for half an hour.’</p>
<p>‘Well, papa, I will go to the devil with you, you know,’ said Matilda
playfully.</p>
<p>‘No! my darling girl, you shall <hi rend="i">not</hi> go to the devil with me,’ replied
her father with emotion; ‘you have already one parent in a better
place, and <hi rend="i">you</hi> shall meet her again.’</p>
<p>‘O! papa, <hi rend="i">we</hi>!’ said Matilda, as they returned to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>‘So, sir,’ said Mr. Légere, as Mr. Cotton re-entered the room with
his daughter, ‘you've recovered the fair fugitive! in my country,
mademoiselle! we soon stop the flight of young ladies that make too free
a use of their wings!’</p>
<pb n="54"/>
<p>‘You shoot them, I suppose, sir?’ said Matilda.</p>
<p>‘No; we've cages called convents,’ said Mr. Légere.</p>
<p>‘And iron rings, bolts, leg locks, and handcuffs, to confine them to
the bars, I suppose, sir?’ said Matilda.</p>
<p>‘O,’ said Mr. Légere, I see where I am now. I am exceedingly
sorry, Miss Cotton, for the fright you received this morning, but I promise
you I'll read all my fellows such a lecture when I go on board, as shall
prevent the recurrence of such an accident. As for the man that was
wounded, whose name is <hi rend="i">Outalissi</hi>, although the wound is merely a
graze across the ribs, it would have served him right if the bullet had
scuttled his knob; he has given me more trouble since his embarkation,
than almost any man I ever took on board: twice he jumped overboard,
once he attempted to scuttle the ship, and latterly he refused all
sustenance, and would have died if we had not had an unusually short
passage; and yet he has nothing to regret in Africa, for, by the account
of Askens, one of my men, who undertook to guide the surprise party to
his village, of which he seemed to be the head, they did not leave a
hearth to shel-
<pb n="55"/>
ter, or a dog to live in it to miss him, and he's quite a young man, not older than
Mynheer Bentinck, so that he may do just as well here, if he would but think
so.’</p>
<p>Matilda changed countenance, and giving a look to Edward Bentinck,
that seemed to say, ‘You are a man, rebuke him,’ left the room.</p>
<p>‘Morbleu!’ said Mr. Légere. ‘Do the Surinam ladies think it's
possible to carry on a slave trade with rose water?’</p>
<p>‘I am not,’ said Edward Bentinck, ‘a Surinam lady, or quite a
stranger to military carnage, and am not startled by the sight of honest
blood; but your business seems to begin, proceed, and end in wholesale
  treachery, cruelty, and murder, robbery, and crime of every sort;<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a001">See Note A.</xref></note>
and, if I were governor of this colony, I would take good care, Mr.
Légere, that this should be your last visit.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, ah!’ said Légere, ‘then you would not be long governor, for
the planters would tell some lie against you or another, and get you
recalled, or make the colony too hot to hold you. The members of the
court of policy, as they call it here, (which is the court of criminal justice,)
are all planters; and even if the governor was to prosecute, 
<pb n="56"/>
they would never condemn, because they know they are all obnoxious to the
same charge; and as for religion, pity, compassion, philanthropy, and all that
humbug, who ever heard or met with a Dutchman out of Vaderland who would
sacrifice a stiver to any one of them?’</p>
<p>‘Frenchmen, I suppose,’ said Edward, looking sternly at Mr.
Légere; for he did not think it worth while to take up more seriously the
championship of his country with the captain of a slave ship.
‘Messieurs de la grande nation, of that description of character, are
never to be met with out of La belle France.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, monsieur!’ said Mr. Légere, with a grimace of momentary
pensiveness; and either only hearing the last words of the observation
addressed to him, or in his intense national and personal conceit
overlooking its irony, ‘Je sais bien qu'il n'y a qu'une France!’</p>
<p>‘But, Mr. Légere,’ continued Edward, ‘after having done every
thing to exasperate your unhappy victims, do you never try to soothe
their feelings when you get them on board?’</p>
<p>‘O yes, every thing,’ said he. ‘We physic, flog, and iron them;
and sometimes, if there is much smother, we throw a dozen or two
overboard to make room for the rest to breathe.’</p>
<pb n="57"/>
<p>‘Every thing but mercy, humanity, and kindness,’ said Edward;
‘and that last act which you mentioned must often be one of the
greatest of them. May I ask if it is alive or dead that you throw them
overboard when you are too crowded?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, c'est égal,’ said Mr. Légere, ‘qu'importe cela? But,’ said
he, suspecting that Edward was laughing at him, ‘<hi rend="i">Outalissi</hi>, who now
belongs to Mr. Cotton, speaks very good English; he was accustomed, I
believe, to attend when he was a boy, and latterly to conduct, on his own
account, a little sort of commercial caravansera from the interior to
Sierra Leone, and he will tell you more about it. He's a fine subject, Mr.
Schwartz, for you to try your hand upon, and I have brought some blue
parrots for mademoiselle, that I believe I must first place under your
care, to break them of the bad language they have learned on board the
Harpy.’</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz made no reply to this stroke of raillery, but being engaged
to sleep at a plantation within a hundred yards of the military post,
challenged Edward to accompany him home; and their host, who
seemed absorbed in his own reflections since his return into the room
  with Matilda, merely wished them a good night, and they departed.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<l>‘His warfare is within; there, unfatigued,</l>

<l>And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself;</l>

</lg>

<p>‘<hi rend="sc">You</hi> are a married man I presume, Mr. Schwartz, and have been a
missionary here for several years?’ said Edward interrogatively, as
they walked slowly over the sandy shore that lay between Mr. Cotton's
and the military post; whilst the peace-dispensing and solemnizing
beams of a nearly full moon seemed to darken the thick foliage which
absorbed them on one side of their path, and lighten the glistening water
which reflected them on the other.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘I have a wife and children at
Paramaribo, without whose support I must often have sunk under the
weight of all the anxious responsibilities and difficulties
<pb n="59"/>
that attach to the situation of a missionary in this colony, where I have
endeavoured to support that character now for nearly twenty years.’</p>
<p>‘Are there not,’ said Edward Bentinck, ‘besides the original
Indians, two considerable settlements of free and self-emancipated
negroes, with whom, of course, you have occasional intercourse; have
you succeeded at all in your missionary exertions with them?’</p>
<p>‘Here and there one,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘appears to have
imbibed some faint notions of the doctrines of Christianity, generally
however certainly not; but then our means have been of the feeblest and
most inadequate kind; and ask yourself what right we could have to
expect from a people who had never, literally never, received any thing
but misery, circumvention, and ill usage from the whites; an act which
implies the greatest of all confidence, viz. the receiving their religion
from them?’</p>
<p>‘Why, not much, to be sure,’ said Edward Bentinck; ‘but tell
me, honestly, Mr. Schwartz, your opinion on another question: When I
left England, there was rather a fashionable school of infidelity, which
ascribed most, if not all the miseries of life, to the refinements of
civilization. From your opportunities of comparative observation here,
<pb n="60"/>
(and they must have been abundant,) do you really think there is any ground
for this opinion?’</p>
<p>‘So far from it,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘there is not a single misery
incident to civilized life to which they are not subject, with scarcely any of
our alleviations or compensations; their bones are equally fragile, their
flesh and blood equally susceptible of distemper, pain, and death, and
they have no surgeon, chemist, or physician. There is not a moral
trespass that they don't practise against each other, and there is no law
for them in this life but that of the strongest, who monopolize the women
and plunder the weak; - and no supporting knowledge of retribution
beyond the grave, not to mention the unspeakable amount of positive
happiness and enjoyment that arises to a cultivated mind from the mere
act of exercising the mental faculties and reflection upon a boundless
variety of subjects, physical and metaphysical, from which the savage is
entirely cut off. And so far from their bodily strength and power of
enduring fatigue being greater than those of the natives of civilized
countries, it is quite the reverse. But the most decisive confutation of
that theory is this fact, that in savage life (the only portion of it at least
with which I am acquainted, viz. that of the Indians and Bush Negroes of
this
<pb n="61"/>
colony,) their numbers rapidly diminish, whilst in the civilized world
population as rapidly increases. The increase of population has been always
found co-progressive with the increase of happiness; and, in my humble
opinion, the happiness of all communities must depend upon the commensurate
  diffusion of intelligence and self-discipline.’<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a002">See Note B.</xref></note></p>
<p>‘Do you,’ said Edward, ‘believe there is any essential inferiority
in the Africans that incapacitates them from ever attaining the same
state of civilization as the Europeans?’</p>
<p>‘No one, certainly,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘has a right to say so,
until the same moral apparatus of instruction has been applied to their
education, which has never yet been done. I should feel, perhaps, more
difficulty in disputing the existence of some actual difference in the
comparative force of their mental faculties in relation to each other, or at
least the mode of exercising them, their memory sometimes seems
much stronger than that of Europeans, as well of intellectual impressions
as sensible objects; but their imagination is more sensual, and therefore
less subservient to the elevation of their understanding and their
acquisition of science; they are, in fact, (and, in truth, I doubt whether it
is not the 
<pb n="62"/>
only difference,) rather more directly under the government of their senses than
Europeans, and therefore less capable of abstract reasoning or comprehending
abstract principles; but whether all or any, or how much of this difference is
circumstantial and accidental, or essential and proper, cannot be absolutely
determined till their circumstantial degradation is removed. It is clear, however,
that man's rational nature can only rise and expand as his animal one sinks and
is contracted, and therefore a single degree of elevation or depression in one or
the other may make the difference between a civilized and a barbarous
people.’</p>
<p>‘I confess,’ said Edward Bentinck, ‘my doubt of their equal
capacity arises front the fact of their making no advance towards actual
equality with their oppressors. That they should suffer such miscreants
as yonder Frenchman to pillage, slaughter, and enslave them, adlibitum,
for centuries, seems to me a marvellous thing, if their utmost capacities
did not under-reach his; they have the same provocation to exert them
that the Britons and Gauls received from the Romans.’</p>
<p>‘The Romans civilized,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘partly by
extermination and partly by intermixture. There is no reason to think that
the original Gauls or Britons would have ever emerged from
<pb n="63"/>
barbarism by their powers of self-elevation any more than the poor Africans. If
large modern European armies were to overrun and occupy the continent of
Africa, no doubt the process of civilization would soon be commenced there;
the only other means are those which England is now so earnestly and
disinterestedly trying, viz. those of invitation to commercial intercourse and
instruction.’</p>
<p>‘Your undertaking, Mr. Schwartz,’ observed Edward, ‘is a very
noble one, but its prosecution in such a place as this must often, I
should think, be extremely disagreeable.’</p>
<p>‘If in this life only we had hope,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘we should
indeed be of all men the most miserable to the world's eye; and, indeed,
actually as far as the sacrifice of worldly enjoyment goes, a missionary's
life is or ought to be one of great privation and suffering; but we have a
recompense of accumulating value and support as we approach its
realization in the promises of our Master.’</p>
<p>‘To be sure,’ said Edward, ‘one of the best philosophical
receipts for, and definitions of, happiness, is the selection of some noble
object of pursuit with the consciousness of progress towards it, your
object is noble, but where is your progress?’</p>
<pb n="64"/>
<p>‘The want of general progress,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘if now and
then a case of incontestable reformation confirms our confidence in the
saving power of Christianity individually, does us no harm; on the
contrary, it only throws us more upon our internal resources, and leads
us again and again to authenticate our commission by comparing its
external signatures with the genuine moral inscriptions written by the
finger of God in our own bosoms and consciences; and so long as our
faith remains unshaken, so long as our confidence in Him, in whom we
have believed, becomes more and more confirmed upon every
examination, (which it will do if all is sound within,) the life even of a poor
Moravian missionary, however ill appreciated and overlooked by the
world, is not without great peace and joy, and aspirations at least of
such sublimity</p>

<lg type="poem">
<l>‘As give assurance of their own success,</l>
<l>And which infused from heaven must thither tend.’</l>
</lg>

<p>If our visible progress was very rapid and decisive, the applause and
acclamation of the world would suspend our introspection, and out of
constant requisition our spiritual armoury might rust; - like the staff of a
dismantled regiment, we must keep our post with fidelity and fortitude,
<pb n="65"/>
recommending our Master's service to the utmost of our power, both by
argument and a carriage of cheerful confidence and satisfaction in it ourselves,
till he is pleased to fill our ranks, and in the mean time to remember, as the
English general Wolfe used to say, that the great business of a soldier is to die;
not that the surface of society is really any criterion of the progress of
Christianity, - like leaven in meal, it is doing its silent subsurficial work on
multitudes of spirits that are perhaps hourly passing to their reward without
discernibly altering the external appearance of the mass.’</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Edward, ‘whilst your visible success remains so very
limited, the suspicion and jealousy, if not personal violence, to which you
must be subject in a place like this, must be very trying: and the taunts
and sneers, and blasphemies and revilings against your faith, and some
of its undeniable and inexplicable mysteries, such, for instance, as the
reconciliation of the existence of <hi rend="i">any</hi> evil with infinite and Almighty
benevolence, if it does not shake your allegiance to it, must
proportionally shock it; to hear constantly impugned either the justice or
mercy of Him you love so well, and of whose essential goodness you
have such intimate conviction, although you know not always how to
vindicate it, must be very dis-
<pb n="66"/>
tressing if it does not gradually impair your affection.’</p>
<p>‘Our affection is uphold, perhaps, by an unseen hand,’ said Mr.
Schwartz, ‘but an object once dearly beloved is not often displaced
from the affection by abuse; the pain it gives, indeed, is excessive, but
this will be more than requited when He, whom we have presumed to
love, in the confidence of his goodness that no impeachment of it by
others has materially weakened, no adversity or sufferings of our own
extinguished or reduced, shall vindicate his own ways to the moral
apprehensions of an assembled world. How often in a human court of
justice have I seen the friend, or child, or brother of the person
arraigned, who have been writhing with agony whilst the counsel for the
prosecution were inveighing against the latter, when an advocate in his
defence repelled every slander, and sent him with unsullied honour out
of court, burst into tears of joy and gratitude from the triumph of his
unshaken affection, and the sudden relief of his own honest sympathy.
Think, then, with what exultation and rapture the meanest of God's
faithful and affectionate servants (not to say children) who through every
shape of trial have retained their allegiance unto death, will join the final
anthem of triumphant adoration,
<pb n="67"/>
‘Holy! holy! holy! Lord God of Sabaoth, just and true are thy ways, O King of
Saints!' But I am tiresome, Mr. Bentinck,’ said he, as Edward seemed to
be abstractedly playing with and rubbing the lapel of his coat.</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Edward, ‘I listen to you with great pleasure; but I was
thinking you made this Waterloo medal of mine look rather dull.’</p>
<p>‘The most painful incident to our duty here,’ continued Mr.
Schwartz, ‘is, that in exact proportion to the earnestness of the
interest in Christianity which we excite in the unhappy slaves is the
severity, I had almost said cruelty, of the struggle we impose upon them;
besides the perpetual taunts and spite with which their fellow-slaves are
often encouraged, by the directors, in galling them. Not only are no
facilities afforded, but every possible obstruction is generally interposed
to their compliance with the ordinance of marriage; and some masters
positively forbid their slaves being baptized. Even of the doctrine of
equality with their masters in the next world, so prominent on every page
of the Gospel, and indeed so obvious a feature of its very essence
(although one should think it a doctrine rather likely to allay their
impatience of their inequality in this) I have heard the greatest jealousy
expressed by one of the
<pb n="68"/>
first official men in the colony. In such a state of things, therefore, where the
whole social edifice is not only not Christian, but violently anti-Christian from
turret to foundation-stone, I often feel, that to call for Christian duties from the
poor inmates in the double fetters of heathen ignorance and atheistical or infidel
owners, is to call upon them for a task surpassing human strength, and all
ordinary and  unpresumptuous expectation of divine aid. I am not contending
that the status or condition of slavery in the abstract is incompatible with
Christianity, because Christianity does not interfere with the external relations
of society, so long as they do not actually obstruct its work, which is not with
the body, but the soul; but I'm afraid that Dutch slavery is incompatible,
because it does so, which often involves us here in the most painful
embarrassments. But I will illustrate this by a most distressing catastrophe,
which occurred here not very long ago, when a fine young man of about thirty,
who had been nearly ten years a member of our society, cut his throat; his
Christian names were John Christian February, but before he was christened his
master used to call him Quashee Sambo, and Quashee Sambo therefore every
body else continued to call him to the day of his death. Quashee, at the time he
was christened, lived with
<pb n="69"/>
a negress about his own age, whom we made him put away, till they could both
obtain their freedom, without which the obstacles to domiciliation, and
therefore to all the moral duties of marriage in Surinam (my present
observations are confined to this colony) are insurmountable, and that then we
should gladly and lawfully re-unite them. Quashee said, he was afraid he could
not bear it; and we thought ourselves authorised, perhaps injudiciously, to tell
him that we trusted God would support him, and that he had promised
compensation even in this world for all such sacrifices. His master also, a man
of great benevolence, and of whom Quashee was a particular favourite, for he
was a steady, faithful, docile, good lad, encouraged him by promising his
freedom at his death at the latest, if he behaved well. Strange as it may seem,
under these encouragements, Quashee regularly attended our communion, and
persisted in a state of honest celibacy, as far as any thing is known to the
contrary, for ten years, during which time he had saved money enough to
purchase the freedom of his sweetheart, who was equally faithful to him, and he
meant upon his master's removal to heaven, as he said, for he was much
attached to him, to go back to Africa, and try to find his father and mother, from
whom he had
<pb n="70"/>
been torn when quite a child, and make Christians of them and his brothers and
sisters, if he had any, or some of his countrymen at all events, if he could not
discover his relations; and he was looking to the full reward of his constancy
when his master was killed by a fall from his horse, before he had time to make
his will, and his affairs were found so insolvent, that the administrators were
compelled to order Quashee to be sold by auction, which had no sooner been
done, to a man of notorious hostility to every shape and form of religion, but
especially disdainful and derisive of any that imposed the slightest restraint
upon sexual intercourse, than our poor hapless convert, for I will still call him
so, went home to his negro-house and cut his throat. We had taught him to read
and write a little, and in the fly-leaf of his Testament was found a note,
addressed to one of my brother missionaries, stating in effect that he had
hitherto supported the restraints of Christianity from the hopes which his
master's sudden death had indefinitely postponed and disappointed; but as his
fear of God's anger would now make it impossible for him ever to enjoy the
unconsecrated renewal of his intercourse with Africana, and all hopes were
gone of any other, he felt that life was no longer supportable, and that although
suicide
<pb n="71"/>
might perhaps be wrong, yet as he did not see it so expressly forbidden in God's
book, as unmarried intercourse with the other sex, he hoped the former was at
all events the least offence of the two, and that the Christian's God would fulfil
to him in the next world the promises upon which he had too much depended in
this; that he had endeavoured since his baptism to act up to the Christian
direction of doing to others as he would be done by, and was not conscious of
any obliquity in the general sincerity and earnestness of his intentions and
efforts to act right and discharge his duty both to God and man, although he
might not always have succeeded; that as he was sure his Christian father had
meant kindly by him, he wished him every good and sincerely thanked him for
the pains he had taken with him, and prayed that he might never know the
agony which his heart was then sustaining; but before he made any more
proselytes, hoped that he would consider well if he was not himself deceived;
that, finally, he begged us all to forgive him, and not to be sorry for him (as he
was afraid we should), as since his separation from Africana, he had never in
fact had an hour's happiness in this world, and now between Christianity and
slavery he felt that he never could.’</p>
<pb n="72"/>
<p>‘But,’ said Edward, ‘where marriage is rendered actually
impossible (as it appears to me generally in this colony) by the irreligion,
tyranny, and forcible prevention of others, over whom the parties wishing
to marry have no controul; do you insist upon the ceremony as a <hi rend="i">sine
qua non</hi> of conjugation?’</p>
<p>‘Since the occurrence I have mentioned,’ said Mr. Schwartz,
‘we have not always done so, but as much as we can, we make such
parties consider themselves as man and wife; but you see all the
misrepresentation to which we expose ourselves by this, and the
mischief to which such a relaxation of religious discipline is open from
the liability of the parties (where there is no legal sanction of their union)
to separation. How can Christianity ever be grafted upon such a system
as this?’</p>
<p>‘Curse the system!’ said Edward. ‘I beg your pardon, Mr.
Schwartz; but I almost wish you had not told me so much about it. I shall
be thinking of poor Quashee Sambo all night.’</p>
<p>By this time the two spiritual and temporal soldiers having arrived at the
barracks of the latter, the former, having no time to accept his
companion's invitation to supper, pursued his way to the adjacent
plantation, and left Edward reflecting so deeply upon what he had heard,
that he did
<pb n="73"/>
not go to bed before he had turned poor Quashee Sambo's testamentary epistle
into the following verses: -</p>
<lg type="poem">
<head>Quashee's lament.</head>
<l>In vain I backward search life's stream,</l>
<l>On memory's page imprinted,</l>
<l>To find with mercy's golden beam</l>

  <l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>O Christian, wherefore, in this sea</l>
<l>Of struggle overbearing,</l>
<l>Hast plung'd my soul, that but for thee,</l>
<l>Life's joys might still be sharing.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>

<l>And slavery's here my lot;</l>
<l>Within me <hi rend="i">now's</hi> the hell you teach</l>

<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>You've wronged me, Christian, well you know,</l>
<l>That nature's joys you've banished,</l>
<l>And all your promises in woe,</l>
<l>And doubt, and death have vanish'd.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>Where is the hundred fold reward,</l>

<p><hi rend="sc">Edward Bentinck</hi> had just finished his breakfast the next morning,
and was sinking into a profound reverie on the conversation and events
of the preceding day, debating with himself how far it was his duty to
report to his superiors what he had seen, first communicating fairly to
Mr. Cotton the obligation he found himself under of so doing, when
Serjeant Vanderdonder informed him that an English sailor was waiting
to speak to him. An English sailor, said Edward - what can an English
sailor possibly want with me? however, hand him in, serjeant; and
accordingly with a short scrape of the foot, nod of the head, and hitch
<pb n="76"/>
of the trowsers, but with a sort of curtailed and begrudged obsequiousness that
seemed to express a full consciousness that it was but a swab of a Dutchman
that he was addressing after all, Jack was introduced to the presence. ‘Your
name and business with me my lad?’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘My name's Bob Jackson, your honour; and my business is to
swear.’</p>
<p>‘That's a business, Bob, of which I am afraid you are but too capable
yourself, without my assistance,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘Why as to the matter of that,’ said Bob, ‘I can't say but our
lingo is not always quite as much like a parson's blessing as it shou'd
be, but what I means at present is to swear against that d--d French
lubber Captain Ledger, as they calls him.’</p>
<p>‘Well, what have you to say against him, Bob?’ said Edward.
‘Did I not see you amongst the men that shot that poor negro in Mr.
Cotton's walk yesterday morning? are you not therefore one of his
crew?’</p>
<p>‘No, thank God!’ said Bob, ‘not now. I was only engaged for the
voyage, and as soon as he come on board last night, and gave us a
good rating of his d--d aggravating French jabber for being so handy
with our fire-arms in this here
<pb n="77"/>
civilized country, as he called it, I told him a bit of my mind, that his trade was
nothing better than piracy and murder, that I 'd seen quite enough of it, and
therefore if 'twas all the same to him, should be glad if he 'd pay me my wages
and put me ashore, which he was glad to do the first thing this morning, lest, as
he said, cursing me for an English hypocrite, 'I should infect the rest of his crew
with my dislike to the service.' So I thought I 'd come to your honour, and see
if I couldn't lighten my conscience a little, by taking my <hi rend="i">davy</hi> of what I 'd <hi rend="i">see'd</hi>
since I went a board that hell boat!’</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Edward, ‘does not the captain, when he engages
you, exact a promise from you not to disclose what you see?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Bob, colouring, ‘a promise is a promise, although
made to the devil himself; and although we British sailors are queer
fellows sometimes, I must confess, there are not many of us that would
  break our <hi rend="i">sea word</hi>;<note n="*" place="foot">Engagements contracted under the pledge of their professional honour,
    I suppose Jack meant - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author.</hi></note> but if he was to <hi rend="i">ax</hi> for any promise of that
sort before he engaged us, he'd be shewing his colours too soon, before
he knowd whether 'twas friend or foe that he was speaking to, and may
be he'd never get his com-
<pb n="78"/>
plement at all, for its too bloody a business for any but such as are next kin to
the devil to engage in knowingly; they trusts to this, that, if they puts theirselves
in our power we puts ourselves in theirs; but, if I was to be hang'd to morrow, I
could not rest till I had giv'd information of all I knowd. I hope your honour
will not say as 'twas I as told you, at least for the next two months. You're
welcome to make what other use of the information you please, and I'm ready
to swear to it; but these slave traders are spiteful fiends, as your honour may
suppose, and if they was to know as 'twas I as started the law upon them, till I
am fairly out of their reach, 'twould be as much as my life's worth to open my
lips about the business.’</p>
<p>‘Well, well,’ said Edward, ‘I'll not betray you into any danger, I
promise you, therefore fire away my lad, only dont be too prosy. I 've
rather a curiosity to hear your story, but I have no authority to take your
oath.’</p>
<p>‘Well, your Honour, this is my story. I come out to the West Indies a
few months ago on board His Majesty's sloop of war, the Saucy Anne,
as brisk and fine a boat as ever swam, your honour, and when we come
off Martinique, for some words which I had with the boatswain, the
captain, he's
<pb n="79"/>
not a bad man neither, said as hands were plenty now, he'd give me my choice
of a good buffing, or a run amongst the Frenchmen without my wages, so, - that
buffing's no joke, your honour! - as I thought I should soon get on board an
English ship again by some wind or other, I chose the latter, and had not been
long cruising about St. Pierre's, before this Captain <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi>, as they calls him,
seeing me unemployed, said I was a good likely sea looking lad, and asked if I
had a mind to take a run with him to Africa for a cargo of <hi rend="i">mules</hi>, as he should
sail next day, and was rather short of hands? Being quite out of prog, your
honour, and rather sulky at the moment, I said I didn't care, and he took me a
board with him immediately. When we came into the Bight of Benin, I soon
found what a cargo of mules meant, and one of the men, an Englishman like
myself, of the name of Bill Askens - (there are black sheep in all professions
your honour!) - said he knowd of a king as liv'd somewhere in those parts,
about twenty miles up the country, that had taken him home and cured him of a
fever once when he was wrecked upon that coast, and that if the captain would
send a dozen hands with him, and give a trifle head money, he'd bring away the
whole village, king and all. Accord-
<pb n="80"/>
ingly I was ordered of the party, and exactly at midnight - (for Bill knowd the
way very well) - we arrived at a long straggling street of rush cabins, which was
- (I think Bill called it) - the metropolis of King Outalissi. This village was
surrounded by a sort of wattling fence too high to be overlooked, and too stiff
to be easily pushed through, but with only one entrance, giving the poor
inhabitants the idea of security, but in fact, proving their destruction. Across
this entrance Bill ordered us to dig and cover such a trench as it was impossible
they could pass without falling into or over it, and to remain there whilst he
went and set fire to the opposite end of the village, which happened also to be
the windward end, and which, as soon as he had done, 'Now then,' said he,
'take it easy, boys! take it easy, boys! You'll see what bolting there'll be by and
by!' Accordingly, as soon as the poor unsuspecting savages heard their hovels
crackling over their heads, and saw the blaze by which they were surrounded,
they all rushed out helter skelter in the greatest confusion, overthrowing each
other into the trench; and by binding them as fast as they fell with the cordage
and crippling irons with which we were provided, we soon had all the natives in
our possession, but one who was too
<pb n="81"/>
strong and active for us, and escaped into the woods, and now,’ said Bob,
biting his lips and looking inward, ‘began, what upon my soul I'm
ashamed to tell your honour the rights of, although I'm not <hi rend="i">purtikler</hi>
bashful neither, but I will only say, that after the most violent and brutal
indulgence of our men with the women and womenchildren, and the
slaughter of all <hi rend="i">as</hi> persisted in their resistance, we found ourselves the
next morning, (besides the infants as we was obliged to leave to perish
at the breasts of their dead mothers, and several whose broken limbs or
excessive sickness from their fright and ill usage made it impossible as
we could move,) in the possession of nearly a hundred slaves of all
sorts, men, women, and children. Early in the morning, just as we were
about to march off with our prize, the person who had escaped come
  stealing out of the woods to <hi rend="i">reach an oyster</hi>,<note n="*" place="foot"> Reconnoitre I suppose. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author</hi>.</note> I thinks 'twas as Bill
said, or some such lubberly lingo, as he larned when he was a soldier,
for this Bill isn't above a half-bred sort of a land swab of a sailor after all,
your honour, or he'd never be so bloody, cruel, and such an ungrateful
villain as he is. <hi rend="i">Howsumdever</hi> 
<pb n="82"/>
the poor man came out of the wood to see how the wind sit, as I should say, and
Bill said that this was the King Outalissi, for he knowd him very well, by reason
of having lived several weeks with him and his father, who was since dead,
when they took Bill home with 'em to nurse him and cure him of his fever after
his shipwreck. When our people heard he was King Outalissi, most of 'em was
for scuttling his knob, as they said, for fear of his bringing down a rescue upon
us, for as for catching him, as well attempt to catch His Majesty's sloop of war
the Saucy Anne, under top, top-gallant royals, sky-scrapers, and moon-rakers,
when she tears through it like a rocket your honour; but Bill said, 'No! no! put
up your levellers and bilboas lads; we must take him alive, or we shall lose the
very pride of the haul, when they've had him digging out their d--d Dutch
coffee dams.' Just so, your honour; for Bill was always very ready with his
tongue, although I told him that I didn't see why Dutch coffee dams should be
more d--d than any other, your honour.’</p>
<p>‘Well, go on,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘When they 've had him' (continued his informant) 'digging out their
d--d Dutch coffee
<pb n="83"/>
  dams in Surinam for a twelvemonth over his --<note n="*" place="foot"> An hiatus in my copy of this deposition makes it impossible to supply
    this word. I suppose Bill meant <hi rend="i">up to his waist</hi>. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author</hi>.</note> in mud, exposed all day
as naked as he was born, to sun, wind, and rain, without either shade or shelter;
they'll have taken some of the royal shine out of his Majesty's breeches,' said
Bill, just so, with a sneer, your honour; as I told him, royalty was royalty,
breeches or no breeches, your honour. And with that Bill brought forward an
old woman, that he said was King Outalissi's mother, for we could not find that
he had wife or children, in order that the king might see that we had his mother
a prisoner. As soon as the king distinguished his mother, your honour; he
jumped, and tore, and struck his breast, and threw himself upon his knees, and
beat his head against the earth, and clenched his hands, and seemed to me like a
ship in her last throes before she founders, your honour; but Bill said, 'let him
flounder about a bit; let him flounder about a bit; I knows the sprat to catch a
gudgeon! I've got him fast enough I see,' and with that, your honour, Bill went
up to King Outalissi, and palavered with him a little, and at last, he told him,
'that if his majesty would surrender him-
<pb n="84"/>
self up, and come with the rest of his subjects to Surinam, where they'd make a
gentleman of him, (which is a much greater thing than a king, said Bill, and
he'd be much better off than he was in his own country,) he'd let his mother go
free,' to which King Outalissi seemed very agreeable, and it quite seemed to
compose him, your honour; but Bill knowd if he let his mother go before he got
the king in the <hi rend="i">grimpets</hi>, he'd have knocked her brains out with his tomahawk
may be, and been out of sight himself sooner than a shot could follow him, or
perhaps have caught up the old woman, and been too quick for Bill even with
his mother in his arms, and the king knowd as Bill was not to be trusted if he
givd himself up before his mother was free, so 'twas agreed that, after binding
one of the king's hands, his mother was to be unbound altogether, which was
accordingly done, and the old woman might have got a pretty good start into the
wood by the time the king's binding was finished, for she wasn't so old but that
she could have run, although Bill would have caught her again I 've no doubt,
your honour, if 'twas only to aggravate the king, (tried to do it indeed, I know
he would, as he 'd ordered some of the youngest to be ready to start after her
again as soon as he gave the signal,) but she
<pb n="85"/>
positively refused to leave her son, when Bill said jeeringly, your honour, 'that
since she was so pressing, and his majesty had agreed to make his voyage with
him, he'd give his mother her passage for nothing,' but she died, your honour,
about three days after we got on board again, with between thirty and forty
more men, women, and children, some of whom at least died, and some they
were obliged to throw overboard to make room for the rest, or they would have
all died of suffocation and dissentery, your honour; as they <hi rend="i">was</hi> all laid in the
hold one a top of 'tother all night like so many sacks, and only brought upon
deck by a dozen at a time for half an hour twice a day, which made me tell the
captain last night that he was Jonas enough to sink the bravest fleet that ever
left a British port, if the Bible was true, and what is said about heaven and hell
wasn't all a flam, your honour. There are such places as heaven and hell, your
honour,’ said Bob doubtingly.</p>
<p>‘You have given an experimental description of one,’ said
Edward, ‘and its inhabitants, and the best proof of the existence of the
other somewhere, is the contest of the two principles of good and evil in
every man's own heart, and which made you so sensible of the
difference as to take
<pb n="86"/>
the honourable resolution you did of invoking, at any risk to yourself, the
vengeance of even human justice upon those who have become little better than
pure incarnate demons, by exclusively practising the latter; but finish your
story.’</p>
<p>‘That's my story, your honour; I 've nothing further to add; but that
when we arrived off the Marawina, we were ordered to land what
survived of the slaves, and take 'em down the creek to Mr. Cotton's the
planter at Anne's Grove, who would give us a receipt for 'em, which we
did after recovering King Outalissi, who broke away from us after
landing, in yonder walk of Mr. Cotton's, as your honour knows. Now if
your honour will just lend me a Bible for a minute, <hi rend="i">as</hi> I may put my oath
to it, my heart will feel as light as a bird again.’</p>
<p>‘There is a Bible,’ said Edward, after taking down the purport of
Bob's story, and making him subscribe it; ‘but I have no authority to
take oaths.’</p>
<p>‘God has authority,’ said Bob Jackson, ‘its only <hi rend="i">afore</hi> your
honour that I takes my oath to God,’ then kissing the Bible, ‘I
swear as all I says is true, so help me God!’ said Bob.</p>
<p>‘And now I 've heard your story,’ said Edward Bentinck, ‘what
would you have me do with it?’</p>
<pb n="87"/>
<p>‘Just what your honour pleases, if you will only give me time to get
on board my old ship the Saucy Anne again. She's still out here, I
understand, somewhere, and I dare say the captain would forgive me by
this time; they don't use us over well always in the king's service, to be
sure, although his majesty himself, they say, has a fine sailor's heart in
him, God bless him! But he never knows the rights of half that's done in
his name, worse luck, or he'd soon put an end to it; for when we're on
shore, sometimes they hunts us about like wild cats.’</p>
<p>‘And when we're at sea, the cats hunt you, I suppose,’ said
Edward.</p>
<p>‘And when we're at sea, as your Honour observes, the cats hunts us.
But I'd sooner be tied up to the grating for a round five dozen, your
honour, under Captain Switchem of theTottunofog, and he's one of the
readiest men with the cat as ever I heard of, than be consarned again in
such a bloody sarvice as this here slave trading, your honour.’</p>
<p>‘But why don't you take your information to the British commissioners
at Paramaribo?’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘Why, maybe, your honour, they would'nt believe what I says, that I
did'nt know what <hi rend="i">mules</hi> were when this here Frenchman engaged me,
your
<pb n="88"/>
honour, and might get me pen'd up for six months in their putrid black hole
there at Fort Zelandia, till they could send me home to be hang'd or transported
as a felon; for slave trading by the British laws is felony, and liable to death
  without benefit of clargy,<note n="*" place="foot"> Piracy now, thank God. - EDIT.</note> your honour. And besides, your honour, if I'd
been seen going into the British commissioners in my sea gear, I should have
been in more danger from the vengeance of these here traders, your honour;
some of whose spies might watch me, or hear of me from the sarvants. Now, if
your honour will send a copy of my <hi rend="i">davy</hi> to the British commissioners, or put
the governor up to what I've told you, he'll have nothing to do but to send
down the Comet, or any other small war craft that happens to be in the harbour,
and whip up this here Frenchman just as if he fell in with her quite
unsuspecting-like, your honour, without any one's being a bit the wiser how he
got his information.’</p>
<p>‘Well, my lad, I'll consider of it,’ said Edward. So, with the same
nod, hitch, and scrape, as he entered, exit Bob, leaving Edward
Bentinck in a dilemma of no very enviable kind; for he did not know the
British commissioners, and revolted as he was by the outrageous guilt of
the slave trade which had just been laid open to him, he, of 
<pb n="89"/>
course, saw that he could not report his information to the governor without
danger of being looked upon as a busy intermeddling fool, for troubling himself
with what did not concern him, and making them open their eyes where they
wanted to shut them; and the danger which Edward no longer affected to
disguise from himself, and which was a great deal more embarrassing, viz. that
of interrupting his intercourse with the Cottons, who, if any inconvenience
should result to them, would suspect him perhaps of being the author of
intelligence to government from the personal observation, for the opportunity of
which he was indebted to their hospitalities - a suspicion from which his
informant's injunction of secrecy for two months would, for so long at least,
make it impossible he could vindicate himself, and to communicate only a
portion of the information he had received, and keep back the name of perhaps
the most guilty party, namely, the planter to whom the slaves were consigned,
would, besides the inefficiency of it if government pursued any enquiry into the
business as they ought to do, be sacrificing public duty to private feeling.</p>
<p>For a long time Edward inclined to put the deposition quietly in his own
writing-desk, and say nothing about it.</p>
<pb n="90"/>
<p>‘What have I to do with the slave trade,’ said he to himself,
‘horrible as it is? Why should I turn Don Quixote, and stir up a
hornet's nest about me of all the planters here, besides incurring the
secret ill will of all the official authorities, and probably even of that of my
own commanding officer, and hazard besides that hope which,’ said
he, smiling, at the alteration in his own feelings, ‘I would not exchange
for the occupation of any Othello that ever lived, or all the fame and glory
of the world;’ and he spent a great part of the morning endeavouring
to satisfy himself of the honour of keeping his own counsel, and leaving
the slave trade to those whose especial duty it was to attend to it.</p>
<p>‘Are there not fanatics enough in the world,’ continued he in
soliloquy, ‘to run a muck, and tilt at all these things, as Pope says,
without me?’ But it would not do; it was impossible that any zeal in
the suppression of such monstrous ultra-heathen enormities could be
fairly obnoxious to the charge of fanaticism. He then tried another
position. ‘Did not our Saviour himself,’ said he, ‘enjoin the
wisdom of the serpent: and St. Paul declare that all things were not
expedient?’ But his honesty was too stubborn for him still. ‘Base
subterfuge!’ he exclaimed, ‘Who does not see 
<pb n="91"/>
that the expediency there recommended, both by Christ and his illustrious
servant, is an expediency upon general principles and for the general good, and
not an expediency to be determined by the petty and often unwarrantable
wishes of individual egotism. - Here's this excellent man Mr. Schwartz, with a
wife and children, whom such a man <hi rend="i">must</hi> love with ten times the intenseness of
a man of worldly dissipation, even if not absolutely untrue to his nuptial
engagements, yet <hi rend="i">he</hi> cheerfully foregoes that greatest of all luxuries to a
benevolent heart, the pursuit of the means of indulging those we love, confines
them as well as himself to the utmost simplicity of shelter, food, and raiment;
and after these are procured, devotes every spare hour and every spare shilling
to the prosecution of Christianity, asking for no return in this world, but always
carrying a serene and satisfied, although a decisively serious aspect, regardless
of any personal dangers although extending to his life, and cheerfully
committing his family to the protection of that parental Providence of whom his
utmost ambition is to be found a faithful servant at his death, still counting his
utmost services as nothing compared with the value of his Master's favour and
goodness in the pardon of his faults; here also is even my honest friend, who
has brought this dilemma upon 
<pb n="92"/>
me, and who, if something in his breast had not taught him to disdain the
principles of selfish expediency, would never have incurred the danger of
making a disclosure - For shame, Edward Bentinck, to suffer a British seaman
to outdo you in Christian principle and disinterested generosity. - No, Matilda! I
will not sacrifice the singleness of Christian truth and honour even for you;’
and he immediately took his pen and wrote a full account of what he had
learned, (reserving only the name of his informant,) and addressed it to
Colonel Vansomner, his commanding officer at Paramaribo; concluding
his note by saying, that his informant was an Englishman, and had
requested him to send a copy of his deposition to the British
commissioners, which he therefore did by the same opportunity, but
without any accompanying remark whatever of his own either
confirmatory or explanatory; in the mean time, lest the vessel should
escape, he thought it right to send a soldier immediately to head
quarters to acquaint the colonel with the practices which had been
disclosed to him, and which he feared were but of too frequent
occurrence, of course leaving it to him (the colonel) to take whatever
further steps in the business he thought proper; and having ordered a
soldier to proceed immediately with his letter, Edward 
<pb n="93"/>
Bentinck, although very far from <hi rend="i">cheerful</hi>, felt quite satisfied that he had done
the thing which was right.</p>
<p>Of the divine passion of love, in its finest influences, a libertine is no
longer susceptible; but from libertinism Edward's principles had hitherto
saved him, and Edward was in love. Those who have never been so, will
either laugh at his scruples of acting upon the convenient doctrine of
selfish expediency, or condemn his hesitation from such a motive, in
obeying the stern dictates of duty. Those who have been in love will not
deny him the credit he deserves on this occasion for his anti-selfish
  decision.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<lg type="poem">
<l> - ‘O! fatal, fatal day!</l>
<l>When led by false humanity astray,</l>
<l>To save these Christians I became their prey.’</l>
  <l>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<hi rend="sc">Old Play</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<p><hi rend="sc">To</hi> an ingenuous mind the pains of dissimulation is always proportioned
to the claims, which we think those upon whom we practice it, have upon
our affection, gratitude, or candour. Edward Bentinck had great
misgivings, not of conscience, (for he could not but be satisfied that he
had acted right), but of the consequences of the step which he had
taken, to those with whose fate and welfare he scarcely dared
acknowledge to himself the depth and nervousness of his sympathy. But
what was to be done? He could not disclose to his neighbours at Anne's
Grove, the information of which he had been the medium of
communication to the 
<pb n="95"/>
colonial government, without not only defeating the very object of that
communication by promoting the escape of the persons implicated, but
gratuitously compromising the safety of his informant, which he had promised
not to do. For some days, therefore, he discontinued his customary daily visits;
it was not possible, however, in common courtesy, to avoid occasionally
calling.</p>
<p>Upon one of these occasions, about a fortnight after his despatch to
Colonel Vansomner, (to which he had hitherto received no reply), as he
approached the house, he saw in the coffee grounds, a figure, (which
might have been a study for the Royal Academy,) of some one
apparently observing him with very earnest scrutiny, and who, when he
came close to him, made him a very dignified salam.</p>
<p>‘Have you ever seen me before, my friend?’ said Edward
Bentinck; for, seeing him upon an English plantation, he concluded that
he spoke English.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Massa,’ said Outalissi; for my readers will have recognized
the royal savage; ‘I saw you with the lady of this house on the
morning of my being landed from those floating shambles when I
attempted to escape into the wood, and you spoke angrily, Massa, to the
blood-hounds that were baying me. I saw, from the fright the lady was 
<pb n="96"/>
in, that you could not help me more effectually.’</p>
<p>‘I am glad to find,’ said Edward, ‘that the wound you received
was so trifling as to admit of your working in the field so soon.’</p>
<p>‘Oh,’ said Outalissi, ‘the wound was just what they intended it
should be, full of cruelty and short of mercy. I expected they would
pursue me when I plunged into the wood, and calculated upon the
chance (it was, I knew, my last and only one) of returning to the land of
my fathers by the way of a bullet through my head.’</p>
<p>‘But have you no such thing as slavery in your own country?’ said
Edward.</p>
<p>‘O yes,’ said Outalissi, ‘plenty of slavery there too; but that is
principally from defeat in war, Massa, and a thousand contingencies
may restore us to liberty. Besides, from contemplating its possibility from
our childhood, our fortitude, when such a misfortune does befall us, is
less taken by surprise, and being intimately familiar with all the
directions of its pressure upon our bodies as well as minds, we know
much better how to humour and adapt ourselves to our condition.</p>
<p>‘In Africa,’ continued Outalissi, ‘there is often scarcely any
difference between the master and the slave: they eat, drink, hunt, and
work to-
<pb n="97"/>
gether, and the slave becomes sometimes the son or brother of his master by
marrying his daughter or sister; but here the master's a tyrant and the slave a
dog, without any community of hopes, fears, thoughts, wishes, constitution, or
even colour between them, and the only hope that remains to us is that of
  death;<note n="*" place="foot"> I have taken the liberty sometimes of improving Outalissi's language a
    little, (although he spoke very tolerable English,) in order to convey what
    appears to me the force of his impressions with more clearness. - <hi rend="i">Note by the
      Author</hi>.</note> but before that comes to me, oh, for one short grapple upon equal
ground, and secure from interruption, with that Christian traitor, that ungrateful
monster, that bloody tiger, that sea-kite in yonder ship, that at one fell swoop,
by coward stealth and treachery, consigned me and all my tribe to this hideous
and interminable slavery and exile. Savages, they call us; but you shall hear,
Massa.</p>
<p>‘I found him dying on the shore, and I made two of my people bring
him in a hammock a long day's journey to our village. Our virgins fed him
with their kindly bowls of fever balm and sweet saganate; and when they
had restored him to health and strength, supplied him with such articles
of cloathing as our simple habits give us any skill in making, begged him
to think kindly of us, and to return our humble services to the first poor
African 
<pb n="98"/>
whom he met with in similar distress; it is not many moons, since he had left
us.’</p>
<p>Outalissi then went on to relate pretty nearly the same story as that
which Edward had before learned from Robert Jackson.</p>
<p>‘I trust,’ said Edward, ‘you will find your situation here more
supportable than you expect, Outalissi. I think I can answer at least for
one member of the family doing all she can to make it so.’</p>
<p>‘True, massa,’ said Outalissi, ‘if the lady of the house were not
a Christian, I should think her an angel, and with the other slaves should
almost worship her; but we are brought up in Africa with the same horror
and loathing of a Christian or white man as we are of serpents and
scorpions; with us the name of Christian implies all that's cruel,
treacherous, venomous, and deadly, massa! and it's difficult not to
shrink from it, even when it appears under a form so passing fair and
lovely as yon white angel's. But, O massa, here are other forms
approaching, which cannot betray, for they cannot deceive me.’</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Cotton appeared with his director, Mr. Hogshead;
Outalissi did not utter another word, but by his change of eye, a slight
quiver in his upper lip, and the tumultuous move-
<pb n="99"/>
ment of his chest as he resumed his labour, he spoke more eloquently
to Edward Bentinck than if he had drawn the contrast between Matilda
and her father and his prime minister in the strongest language.</p>
<p>After exchanging the usual salutations with Edward Bentinck, Mr.
Cotton immediately proceeded with him to the house, leaving his director
to superintend the cultivation of his coffee till his return.</p>
<p>Matilda had been copying, from an engraving of a celebrated picture in
the collection of the late Duke of Orleans, the figure of an Egyptian
Sorceress with her familiar spirit on her finger, and mechanically
imitating the wild drapery of the figure before her, she had thrown her
shawl lightly over her head like a hood, from beneath which the curls of
her beautiful hair hung rather loosely over her temples as she bent
forward to her drawing; her eyes appeared animated with the same
pensive archness, and her sweet lips to be unconsciously reflecting the
same half unmasked smile as those in the gipsy portrait. On this she
was engaged so intently that she did not for a minute perceive the
entrance of her father and his companion, the latter of whom was so
completely spell-bound, that he involuntarily put his hand on 
<pb n="100"/>
Mr. Cotton's arm to prolong the indulgence of his admiration. But Mr. Cotton,
who could not be insensible of his daughter's personal attractions, was,
perhaps, only induced, by such an intimation that he was by no means singular
in his perception of them, the more hastily to interrupt his companion's
contemplation of them by announcing rather loudly, ‘Mr. Bentinck, my
love!’</p>
<p>‘'Pon my word, papa,’ said Matilda, starting and snatching her
mantle from her head, ‘Mr. Bentinck has been such a stranger for
some days that I think it requires some apology in you to introduce him
so abruptly.’</p>
<p>‘It's too late to make a stranger of Mr. Bentinck now,’ said Mr.
Cotton, significantly; ‘but come, put away your rattletraps, whilst they
bring us some refreshment, as I cannot stay loitering here long with so
many new hands to look after, and your friend, Mr. Schwartz, coming
here every day to teach them that they are as good as their master.’</p>
<p>‘Now, papa,’ said Matilda, ‘you have begun, you know, and I
declare I will defend Mr. Schwartz; - if he teaches the negroes that they
<hi rend="i">may</hi> be equal in the next world; he teaches them also that their only
claim to be so, will depend upon their good conduct and honest
endeavours to act right in 
<pb n="101"/>
this, in whatever state of life it may have pleased Providence to place them,
with which it is not the design of Christianity to interfere, so long as that state
admits of their full and free observance of the worship and duties of
Christianity.’</p>
<p>‘He teaches them a doctrine,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘upon the truth
of which depends their master's condemnation; can they be taught that
God's estimation of character depends upon a conformity to restraints
and principles, of which they see all their masters live in open derision
and defiance, without losing all respect for their masters?’</p>
<p>‘Must their masters always live so?’ said Matilda.</p>
<p>‘Well, my dear, a bargain is a bargain,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘I
promised that I would not interfere with you, and I will not. The
Christianity you put into them, I must flog out of them, that's all, or I
perceive we shall all get our throats cut together.’</p>
<p>‘O papa, that's cruel,’ said Matilda, ‘and makes me cruel, I
cannot continue to instruct them upon such terms,’ and she left the
room, but returned in five minutes, having apparently been shedding
tears.</p>
<p>‘My dear Matilda,’ said her father, embracing her as he met her,
having risen to return to his 
<pb n="102"/>
grounds, ‘I am sorry that I spoke so harshly; I will not break my word
with you or suffer the religion of the negroes to influence my conduct
towards them one way or the other; perhaps one day something may yet
be conceded to the character of your unworthy father, for his affection to
you and his protection of your goodness. We will never renew this
controversy, but you know what has occurred to discompose me a little
at present. Mr. Bentinck, I will not drag you out again in the sun, but I
hope I shall find you on my return, and that you will stay and dine with
us.’</p>
<p>‘If you had not called this morning, Mr. Bentinck,’ said Matilda, as
soon as her father had left the room, ‘I believe I should have sent to
request you to walk over. The Dutch frigate that lays in the harbour has
been down here, and carried Captain Légere and his vessel the Harpy to
Paramaribo, and my father is in daily expectation of being apprehended
as a party concerned in the cargo (which is notoriously illegal) and
confined in the close miserable dungeon of a criminal gaol in the fort
there. Now, we know that the Dutch authorities here would have taken
no notice of any information if they had received it, of their own accord,
nor indeed could they, without the greatest injustice, as when they
overlook nine importations, 
<pb n="103"/>
if they punish for the tenth, the parties prosecuted become victims of
oppression, because of partiality, instead of being examples of justice. We are
afraid, therefore, that some one has conveyed information to the British
commissioners, and in this case, if the evidence is conclusive, we have no hope
of escaping, as the authorities would be exposed, through the report of the
commissioners to the British government, to the censure of their own; and this
French Captain Légere has often declared that if they inflicted the penalties of
the abolition laws upon him, that he would not suffer alone, but that all who had
made a cat's-paw of him should suffer with him. I endeavour, in my father's
presence, to controul my uneasiness and pursue my usual occupations, as I
believe he is more anxious on my account than his own; but that naturally only
increases my agitation, and indeed I <hi rend="i">am</hi> very unhappy, for if my father's
punishment should not extend to his expulsion from the colony, it probably will
to his long temporary removal from hence, where of course I cannot stay
without him. It must be a sapless heart that takes <hi rend="i">no</hi> root in a domicile of even a
few years, and this has been mine all my life. My father,’ continued
Matilda, her voice almost faultering, and with look of some reproach at
Edward 
<pb n="104"/>
Bentinck, ‘thought that the commissioners' intelligence must have
been derived from you, as you were present when the unhappy Africans
were put on shore; but I had too good an opinion of Mr. Bentinck to think
it possible, that without at least some intimation of what he might think
his duty, he would compromise the safety of a family, of which he has
now for several weeks been almost an inmate; but, perhaps, he has
received some directions from his superiors, which it was the object of
his call this morning to communicate or execute.’</p>
<p>‘There is nothing in life,’ replied Edward, that I would not sooner
forfeit than the good opinion of Miss Cotton, because I know her good
opinion could only be permanently won by my never suffering any selfish
wishes or feelings to make me swerve from the honest and disinterested
convictions of my own conscience. There are cases in which the
discernment of duty is so difficult, and the arguments for and against any
particular line of conduct so nearly equipoised, that the only safe and
honourable decision for a Christian is to turn the scale against himself,
and let his own inclinations kick the beam. But I assure you, Miss
Cotton, that I have received no directions or communication whatever
from my superiors 
<pb n="105"/>
upon the subject, nor have I any object whatever in my visit here this morning,
but to inquire after your health, and enjoy the pleasure of your society.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said Matilda, overlooking the equivocal character of the
whole answer, in the decisive, although limited negative of the latter part
of it, and betraying quite undesignedly, that the implication of Mr.
Bentinck's character was by no means an inconsiderable ingredient in
her distress, ‘half my anxiety is at an end. I was sure you were
incapable of such duplicity. But good gracious, Mr. Bentinck, you have
been devouring one of my gloves; I must beg you to restore it to me,
although you have almost destroyed it. I assure you, you will find one of
the biscuits on the table a much better thing.’</p>
<p>‘This is better than either,’ said Edward, seizing (with both his
own) the hand extended by Matilda for the glove, which he had nearly
twisted and bit to pieces in his embarrassment under his examination,
and touching it with his lips.</p>
<p>‘No, Mr. Bentinck!’ said Matilda, withdrawing her hand firmly, but
not resentfully, from his grasp, ‘I must not permit this
misunderstanding for a single moment; I will not deny the esteem I
entertain for you, lest I should be guilty of the very 
<pb n="106"/>
duplicity from which I have this moment but too unreservedly, perhaps,
expressed my joy in your exculpation; but I entreat you for your own sake, not
to think of any thing further, it is impossible.’</p>
<p>‘The esteem of Miss Cotton,’ said Edward, ‘is much too great a
treasure to allow me to run the slightest risk of losing it by any
encroachment on her generosity; but our <hi rend="i">thoughts</hi> will not always be
restrained, even by the consciousness of their presumption.’</p>
<p>‘I must correct you again,’ said Matilda, ‘presumption is a word
inapplicable to the real and sober nature of the case, there would be no
presumption, Mr. Bentinck, in your entertaining such thoughts; but the
irremovable distance of our situation and circumstances makes them
absolute insanity in either of us.’</p>
<p>‘We are both young,’ said Edward, ‘can that distance never be
diminished?’</p>
<p>‘Never!’ said Matilda. ‘You belong to a profession which
deprives you of all controul over your own movements and actions; you
have no security even of remaining in the colony for a single day, and
during the life of my father, every tie off affection and duty bind me
here.’</p>
<p>Edward only replied by a deep sigh.</p>
<p>‘You are too honourable, I know,’ said Ma-
<pb n="107"/>
tilda, ‘to deceive me, and I perceive that you <hi rend="i">cannot</hi> deceive yourself;
let this, therefore, be the last time you compel me to renew the subject. I
am not old, but you are, perhaps, still younger as a man, than I am as a
woman. You have a profession, which has already conferred on you
such distinction and honour as many a lion-heart has wooed all his life
through unnoticed dangers, hardships, and sufferings, without obtaining,
and you have powerful friends at home to find you opportunities of
winning the fullest plume of glory; go, therefore, where glory waits you,
and some twenty years hence, when your name, like that of Nelson or
Wellington, is alike conspicuous in the East, the West, the North, and
the South, and blazes with unrivalled lustre round the world, if Surinam
and your humble acquaintance there, should ever recur to your
recollection, remember, that amongst them there was one who had the
courage to declare to you, that she could only value the glory, even of a
Nelson or Wellington, in exact proportion to the amount of self-subduction, generosity, and forbearance that had been practised in the
progress of its acquisition.’</p>
<p>‘Let me,’ said Edward, ‘keep this memorial of so noble an
injunction,’ drawing at the same time a little Indian plait of grass from
Matilda's 
<pb n="108"/>
work box and tying it round his neck, ‘I will not exchange it for the riband
of the Garter; - if I cannot wear then both, and the principles which I shall
ever associate with this are incompatible with the attainment of the
other.’</p>
<p>‘I cannot forbid such a request as that,’ said Matilda, ‘but do
not misconstrue my acquiescence’ -</p>
<p>‘A soldier to Mr. Bentinck!’ said a servant entering at this moment
-</p>
<p>‘I will come out to him immediately,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>Matilda changed colour, thinking it might be an order for her father's
apprehension; ‘Pray return, Mr. Bentinck,’ said she, ‘I am
alarmed now at the sight of every stranger.’</p>
<p>In a few minutes, after conversing with the messenger, Edward
returned into the room with an air of great vexation, to say that he had
not brought a word of intelligence concerning Captain Légere or her
father; but that a fresh detachment had come down to relieve him at the
outpost, and he was ordered to return with his men immediately to
Paramaribo, in the same boats that had brought down the relief-guard,
for which the tide would not allow him above an hour or two before he
embarked; that he must, therefore, abruptly take his 
<pb n="109"/>
leave, and beg her to make his excuses to Mr. Cotton; ‘and as this may
possibly be the last interview (and is at all events the last for an
indefinite time) which the restless life I have embraced will allow me to
hope for; O pardon,’ said Edward, again raising her hand to his lips,
‘my thus once more expressing the great value I shall ever attach to
the friendship of Miss Cotton.’</p>
<p>Matilda did not think it necessary to rebuke him again at that moment,
and the agitation she betrayed, although relieved from all immediate
apprehensions for her father, was not perhaps to Edward the least
agreeable reply that she could make him. She merely said, however, a
little tremulously, ‘Good bye, Mr. Bentinck, I sincerely wish you
  well!’</p></div><div type="chapter">

<p><hi rend="sc">When</hi> Edward reached his barracks he expressed his surprise at the
abruptness of his recall, to the officer superseding him, and asked if any
reason had been assigned for so much anticipating the usual period of
his relief?</p>
<p>‘None, whatever to me,’ said the officer, ‘I received my
directions from Colonel Vansomner, and he, I believe, his from the
Governor; but I know nothing whatever of the reason; there has been
some noise about a slave ship, that the Kemphaan frigate has brought
up to town; but I did not of course suppose you would be indiscreet 
<pb n="111"/>
enough to defeat the connivance of that trade by the authorities here, by
volunteering any interference with it, or that my directions to relieve you at this
outpost could be in consequence; but if you mean to obey the order of returning
with your men in the boats that brought us down here, you have not a moment
to spare in collecting your things, for it has been flood-water this half hour, and
Sergeant Vanderdonder is, I believe, only waiting your order to embark the
men, as I told him to get them ready. You must sleep for a night at a plantation
about half way, called Bachelor's Adventure, which you will not reach much
before midnight, and the next tide, to-morrow morning, at six o'clock, will
carry you easily to Paramaribo by noon, when you will of course present
yourself to the Colonel.’</p>
<p>In less than half an hour Edward was on his way to the colonial capital.
Whether he should consider his recall as a reproof from his superiors for
his officiousness? What would be the consequences to Mr. Cotton of the
information he had been the medium of transmitting to them? In what
light the share he would be discovered to have had in exposing him to
them, would appear to his daughter, whom the more he saw the more he
admired, and the more undeniably he felt that 
<pb n="112"/>
she had an unrivalled precedence and interest, never to be supplanted in his
heart? Whether she would ever allow him an opportunity of vindication; or on
the contrary, whether it were not almost certain that her father, at least, if not
herself, would interdict for ever all further intercourse between them? These
were no very cheerful subjects of reflection for him during his long row, and
under the depression of which the consciousness of right intention was hardly
able to support him. Will nothing but selfish expediency ever prosper, thought
he in this cursed world? If I had not been a Christian or could but have got over
the uncompromising singleness of motive that Christianity requires of its
professors, and its deep disdain of every shade of hypocrisy and selfish
subterfuge, I might have still been living within the delicious influence of the
presence and society and even acknowledged friendship of that sweet girl, the
opportunity of more successfully cultivating which I have now resigned to
another. But the example and conversation of Mr. Schwartz occurred to him,
and he could not help saying to himself how vulgar is the courage which
enables me or any man to risk his life in energetic exertion, compared to that
stayed confidence in God and the sufficient and abundant reward of his
approbation, which enables 
<pb n="113"/>
a man to endure a long, course of privation and passive suffering with
unrepining composure and even graceful dignity. I know my mother too would
think that I had done right, and tell me that a Christian without sufficient
confidence in the parental providence of God to sacrifice his private wishes
when they seemed to interfere with his duty, did not really deserve the name.</p>
<p>A little incident that occurred at this moment in the boat came
seasonably in aid of Edward's Christian philosophy to divert his
melancholy. Serjeant Vanderdonder said, that since he got into the boat
he missed a parcel of tea and sugar which he had put in before him, and
he was sure one of the negroes with whom he left it must have taken it
out before they left the station, or hid it somewhere in the boat; Edward,
  who recollected the account given by Stedman<note n="*" place="foot"> See Stedman's Surinam, vol. ii.</note> of the superstition
of the negroes, determined to employ the same stratagem as that to
which he had recourse on a similar occasion. The boats here are all built
with a sort of quarter-deck cabin, in the stern of which the folding-doors,
which open towards the stern of the boat when they are shut, appear
completely to enclose those within the cabin from the view of the rowers.
Accordingly, Edward told the negroes, 
<pb n="114"/>
six in number, that a parrot's feather was to grow within six minutes upon the
tip of the nose of him who was guilty, at the same time pronouncing a few
incoherent words, and making two or three circles with his sabre, he shut
himself up within the cabin; here peeping through the key-hole, and observing
the rowers with great attention without their perceiving him, he soon saw one of
them, at every stroke of the oar, put up his hand and feel the tip of his nose;
upon which he instantly ran up to him, and cried, ‘I see the parrot's
feather; thou art the thief, thou rascal.’ To which the poor
superstitious fellow instantly answered, ‘Yes, me, Massa!’ then
kneeling to the sorcerer, as he thought him, for mercy, the serjeant
goodnaturedly said, that in return for his confession he would forgive
him.</p>
<p>‘What an evidence is such superstition,’ thought Edward,
‘impressed upon the wildest and most untutored of the human
species, of the universality of the belief in the invisible world, and the
irresistible power and authority of its agents.’ His abstract reflections
and soliloquies, however, were interrupted for a short time by his
approaching the plantation, where he was directed to remain for the
night, and where he arrived with his party between eleven and twelve
o'clock. The owner of 
<pb n="115"/>
the plantation was not at home, but the officer that had taken Edward's station
at the outpost had prepared the servants to expect the return party, who
occasioned therefore very little derangement. The men were accommodated in
the coffee lodges, and Edward found a good supper prepared for him in the
dwelling house, and a hammock in a room adjoining.</p>
<p>The day had not been one of much bodily exertion, but the pressure
upon his heart and spirits, and the anxiety of mind that the occurrences
of it had occasioned to him, had made it a fatiguing one, he therefore
soon dispatched his supper, and having disencumbered himself of his
  suffocating woollen uniform,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a003">See note C.</xref></note> loosely enveloped himself in a light
linen roquelaure, and threw himself into his hammock. He however had
not been there many minutes, when (before he was overtaken by sleep)
  a naked bust of great symmetry and beauty <note n="†" place="foot">Whoever supposes a sable Venus to be without attraction supposes so from

peared close to his pillow and within the embrace of his arm. ‘I come to tell
massa good night,’ said she. After examining for a few seconds the
object from whence proceeded this address, his hand in moving, some
how or another caught in the beautifully plaited chain of grass which he
had purloined from Matilda, and which still remained upon his neck, and
he said firmly, ‘Good night to you, go!’ and the vision disappeared.
How often in the course of his equatorial campaign this little talisman
acted with equally saving potency, the notes from which this little
narrative is collected do not say. Certain it is that surrounded, as he
was, by every temptation as well as facility of indulgence, nothing but
such a spell upon his heart, or religious impressions of more than
human strength could have preserved him in that point of conduct, from
irretrievable moral ruin.</p>
<p>The next morning Edward proceeded with the tide according to his
directions to head-quarters at Paramaribo, which he reached about
noon, nothing particular having occurred in his progress, and on his
arrival in obedience to his orders, he waited immediately on Colonel
Vansomner his commanding officer.</p>
<p>‘Well, sir!’ said Colonel Vansomner, ‘you've given us a great
deal of trouble here, and got me
<pb n="117"/>
goose beside from the governor for sending such a colonial novice to
that station, but I did not like to banish another to that torrid Siberia, as
we call it here, out of his routine; how could you be so foolish as to
trouble yourself about the slave trade, Mr. Bentinck? Of course you
know it could only be continued here by the connivance of the
authorities, and no man likes to have his eyes opened against his will;
and by informing the British commissioners too, you compel the colonial
government to inconvenience the parties accused, by going through the
forms of prosecution, although the court of policy, whose members are
all planters or administrators of plantations, will no doubt somehow or
another shuffle them out of the scrape, after saving appearances by
letting them lie in prison a few months, till the first bruit of the business is
blown over a little: but this gives a great deal of trouble, and exposes the
colony besides to the complaint of the British government.’</p>
<p>‘I really thought,’ said Edward, ‘that it was the sincere wish of
his Netherland majesty to suppress this frightful traffic, from the laws
that he has passed for that apparent purpose, and the public expression
of his ministers.’</p>
<p>‘Pshaw!’ said Colonel Vansomner, ‘all that, you know, is merely
to humbug the British government; his Netherland majesty's ministers
are 
<pb n="118"/>
obliged ostensibly to comply with whatever directions my Lord Londonderry
pleases to send them, but we know better here than to suppose it can ever really
be the wish of the Dutch government to ruin their own colonies.’</p>
<p>‘I do not believe,’ said Edward, ‘that the solid prosperity of any
community can ever be consulted by the tolerance of such an all crime-comprising practice; but surely if the West Indian interests are in the
state of depression which is contended, the rigid prevention of fresh
supplies of labourers is the only chance that remains of their salvation,
the best way of helping any declining market is to shut out all further
competition, and the best way of helping the existing West Indian
proprietors, I should think, would be rather to contract the field of West
Indian cultivation, than invite fresh speculators to employ new capital in
its extension, by continuing the facilities of obtaining fresh supplies of
African muscle.’</p>
<p>‘Well!’ said Colonel Vansomner, ‘I can't enter into that; you
may now, sir, go and hear what Monsieur Derague the governor has to
say to you upon the subject, as he desired that I would send you to
him.’</p>
  <p>‘So, Mr. Bentinck,’ said the governor,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a004">See note D.</xref></note> on Ed-
  <pb n="119"/>
ward's presenting himself, ‘you are in correspondence with the British
commissioners here I find, to help us in the discharge of our duty.’</p>
<p>‘I could not be aware,’ said Edward, ‘that my furnishing those
gentlemen with information of a case, which I understood it to be their
especial duty to attend to, would be disagreeable to your excellency.’</p>
<p>‘Their duty,’ said his excellency, ‘only extends to the
adjudication in conjunction with his Netherland majesty's commissioners,
of slave vessels found trading under Dutch or British colours, and
brought before them by a Dutch or British cruiser, but like other
gentlemen, it is not very easy always to confine them to their duty; I do
not however blame them so much, their business is of course to affect a
confidence in the earnestness of the wishes of our government to
extinguish this traffic, corresponding with that of their own, or rather of
the English fanatics whom that popular government is reluctantly
compelled to humour, and upon this pretence they are unceasingly
tormenting me with complaints of the continuance of slave importations,
on which occasions my only refuge is to reply, 'procure me conclusive
evidence, gentlemen, and I will take care to punish the offenders you
complain of,' which I know without the kind assistance of such 
<pb n="120"/>
volunteer philanthropists as Mr. Bentinck, it is scarcely possible they should
obtain. One of them the other day wished to advertise a reward for information,
but I told him that did not belong to his functions, and refused him permission
to do so; he then wished me to advertise one myself, as the governors of the
English colonies are in the habit of doing, which also I assured him our Dutch
laws would not allow. I did not anticipate that the Dutch army would have so
soon supplied them with what the Dutch laws denied.’</p>
<p>‘I am sorry that I have incurred your excellency's displeasure by the
step I have taken,’ said Edward, ‘but I did not conceive that my
duties either as a man, a christian, or an officer of his Netherland
majesty, could be at variance with those of gentlemen appointed with his
majesty's concurrence, to put down a practice of which every state in
christendom has expressed its abhorrence and reprobation.’</p>
<p>‘Their duties don't agree with our interests, Mr. Bentinck!’ said the
governor, ‘and as for Christendom, the admission there of these poor
Africans is really only a work of christian humanity, for they would all be
butchered by their own chiefs if they could no longer sell them.’</p>
<p>‘The first reflux of prisoners,’ said Edward, 
<pb n="121"/>
‘with which the slave dealers are now supplied, upon the hands of
their masters might, I'm afraid, be exposed to destruction; but I humbly
submit, if by the introduction of a commercial intercourse their masters
found the labour of their prisoners subserve the same purpose as the
sale of their persons, viz. that of procuring them European articles by
legitimate commerce, they would be too valuable to be in danger of
being wantonly slaughtered.’</p>
<p>‘Well!’ said the governor, ‘by the time you have been here as
long as I have, you will see this subject in a different light, in the mean
time, whilst you remain one of my subjects, I have only to request that
you will confine your philanthropy to the duties of your own service, and
not interfere with mine.’</p>
<p>Without replying to the last observation of his excellency's, Edward only
made his bow and retired, but the worst of this day's gauntlet he had to
run yet, in encountering the sarcasms and derisions of his mess.</p>
<p>‘You got goose from the governor this morning, Bentinck, I
suppose?’ said Colonel Vansomner as soon as they were set down
to dinner.</p>
<p>‘Something like it indeed, Colonel,’ said Edward.</p>
<pb n="122"/>
<p>‘It was my fault too I confess,’ added the Colonel, ‘in some
measure, for not giving you a hint <hi rend="i">not</hi> to see any slave vessels.’</p>
<p>‘How could you be so indiscreet, Mr. Bentinck,’ said Captain
Gencherit, ‘as to stir up a hornet's nest about your ears, by meddling
with the slave trade in such a place as this? as a good Dutchman and
friend to the colony, you should rather help the inhabitants to save
appearances to the British government (which is all the ministers at
home care about) than betray them to it.’</p>
<p>‘I don't know about a good Dutchman,’ said Edward, ‘but as a
good christian, I know I would not by any species of negative
connivance, make myself a party in the unutterable guilt of such a
commerce for the value of my commission.’</p>
<p>‘Christianity!’ exclaimed Lieutenant Van Whistletop, ‘that's all
d--d Humbug and doctrine of ninety-five, nobody here believes in
Christianity, my dear follow!’</p>
<p>‘For that very reason,’ said Edward, ‘this is the last place where
a man of honour would confess any doubts even if he had any. Mankind
have agreed to look upon even religious conversion, the substitution, I
mean, of one view of christianity for another with great jealousy,
because almost all religious questions, from their very na-
<pb n="123"/>
ture, are insusceptible of demonstrative proof, and the motive therefore
is always suspicious, unless an obvious sacrifice of self-interest
accompanies the change; but apostacy has ever been regarded with
unqualified abhorrence, because the difficulties of honest <hi rend="i">dis</hi>-conviction
are at least equal to those of honest conviction, and if in the absence of
certainty a man abjure the faith of his education, he does it at the
desperate risk of committing treason to his maker, his country, and his
own soul, a risk surely which no one in his senses would run except for
the purpose of excusing a vicious life, or advancing some temporal
purposes, and every man's own breast tells him, that the deliberate
abjuration of his religious principles from either of these motives, justly
deserves the infamy which mankind have uniformly agreed to attach to
it.’</p>
<p>‘G--d d--e, Bentinck!’ said the Lieutenant, ‘why 'twould take
me a month at least to understand all that theology, you must have been
brought up for an English bishop to be sure! where the devil did you
learn it all? at Eton, or amongst those d--d English methodists, that are
always preaching liberty and practising <hi rend="i">la loi du plus fort</hi>, taking from us
the best half of Guiana, and stuffing their abolition of the slave trade
down 
<pb n="124"/>
our throats, so as to destroy the value of the remainder?’</p>
<p>‘Without the English,’ said Edward, ‘I don't see very well how
we should have had either ships, colonies, or commerce; beside I've
always understood an ample equivalent was given for Demarara and
Berbice, in the contribution of England towards the expense of fortifying
the frontiers of the Netherlands, and as to the abolition of the slave
trade, the only fault that I have to find with them on that head, is that
they did not go far enough, they thought that the atheistical principles of
the French revolution, with which every country in Europe except their
own had been so long over-run, had left us more right feeling than they
have; they should have made the strict bona fide relinquishment of that
inhuman horrid commerce, the <hi rend="i">sine qua non</hi> of restoring to us any
colonies at all.’</p>
<p>‘Well d--n politics and religion too,’ said Ensign Essuan, who
presided by rotation at the bottom of the table, ‘I hate them both, give
us a toast, Bentinck.’</p>
<p>‘I give you,’ said Edward, ‘Admiral Van Capellan, and his
gallant companions in the attack of Algiers, or if you like it better in fewer
words, the progress of rational liberty.’</p>
<pb n="125"/>
<p>‘I don't care a tinker's curse for either one or the other,’ said the
Ensign, ‘if you had given us the Progress of Pleasure now, I'd have
drank it in as many bumpers as you please; but come, tell us something
of your life out there in torrid Siberia. I understand there's a devilish
pretty girl, the daughter of a Mr. Cotton a planter out there?’</p>
<p>‘I know no lady of that name, exactly corresponding with such a
description,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘Well! exactly!’ replied the Ensign, ‘never mind <hi rend="i">exactly</hi>, but you
know a Mr. Cotton a planter and his daughter Matilda, who live there,
they tell me the latter is quite a nonpareil of beauty and
accomplishments, a perfect model of elegance in her manners, of
decisive christian principles, and what is of much more importance, one
hundred thousand pounds fortune in expectancy besides, in short, a
regular, virtuous, dignified, well bred European lady of the first
attractions.’</p>
<p>Poor Bentinck upon this sally looked a little (as they say) as if he could
not help himself.</p>
<p>‘Oh! Oh!’ continued the merciless Ensign, ‘look at him Colonel!
egad! you must have led a fine mahometan life out there, with Miss
Cotton to go and talk humbug and sentiment to of a morning, and a fine
seraglio of sable houris, I'll answer for it, at your quarters there of an
evening, for 
<pb n="126"/>
the more substantial indulgence of the divine passion; I for my part like the
black houris the best of the two.’</p>
<p>The very association of so gross an idea with an idol that his heart had
enshrined in the purest and chastest radiance of truth, constancy, and
honour, shocked Edward in the same sort of way as sacrilege and
profanation, or some monstrous and impious blasphemy would have
done, and gave him such excessive pain that he half filled a tumbler with
water, to dash into Mr. Essuan's face; but he had been brought up under
strong impressions of the antichristian nature of private duelling, and its
total discrepancy with national war, (the former proceeding generally
from motives of personal resentment, and involving all the feelings of
which Christianity expressly enjoins the subduction, the latter none,) and
he resolved that, at least after he had once had an opportunity of
proving that his courage was quite equal to the public duties of his
profession, he would never fight a duel, he therefore by an effort of self-command drank off the water that was intended for his gay collocutor,
and merely said quietly, ‘Sir, any man who is capable of the one
indulgence, would be unworthy of the other.’</p>
<p>‘Why you don't mean to say,’ observed the 
<pb n="127"/>
Ensign, ‘that there's any harm in such indulgence?’</p>
<p>‘I do mean to say,’ said Edward, ‘that there is very great harm
in every practice which desecrates the divine passion of love, upon the
sanctimonies of which depend all the benignant charities of life. The
religious sanction of that passion in fact by the institution of marriage, is
the great hinge upon which the moral refinement of all communities
must turn, and in proportion to its observance or neglect, all nations
must either advance in civilization or retrograde towards barbarism; what
says Dr. Esquirol on the effect of the banishment of religious influence in
  France?’<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a005">See note E.</xref></note></p>
<p>‘Marry or be d--d then seems your maxim,’ said the Ensign.</p>
<p>‘Marry, or abstain, is the direction of religion,’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘To marry and be ruined is the practice of a fool,’ said the Ensign.</p>
<p>‘To marry and renounce the vanities of ostentation and display is the
practice of a wise man,’ said Edward. ‘If you are not a man of
fortune, you must choose between the enjoyment of domestic
happiness, 'that only bliss of paradise which has survived the fall,' and
the indulgence of the pride of aristocratic station.’</p>
<pb n="128"/>
<p>‘D--n pride,’ said the Ensign, ‘indulgence of pleasure, married
or unmarried, is all I contend for; and if you or any other man says
there's any harm in that, or pretend in that respect to more purity than
your neighbours, by G--d, I say, you're a d--d hypocrite.’</p>
<p>‘Don't bluster, Essuan,’ said Colonel Vansomner, ‘or you'll get
the worst of it, I see.’</p>
<p>‘I make no pretensions,’ replied Edward, ‘and measure out no
man's guilt, which is perhaps only a question of degree and
circumstance between any of us. I may not be pure, but that will not
deter me from insisting upon its being the duty of us all to make the best
fight we can against impurity; but, gentlemen,’ continued he, rising,
and with great firmness, ‘in reference to Mr. Essuan's application to
me of so revolting a term as hypocrisy, I shall perhaps still more surprise
him, by declaring it to be against my conscience to fight a duel. After
this, no man of real courage will insult me, I am sure; should any other, I
can only say,</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>“The man that will traduce because he can</l>
<l>with safety to himself is <hi rend="i">not</hi> a man.”’</l>
</lg>
<p>This answer, delivered with the most composed determination,
effectually puzzled the Ensign, and put an end to the discussion, and the
conversation took another channel till the officers dispersed.</p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p>I trust upon the whole the reader will think my <hi rend="i">white</hi> hero acquitted
himself well here. Such trials may appear trifling in parallel pages with
those of Fox's Book of Martyrs, but they are by no means so in reality to
the modern disciple who values, as he ought to do, his Christian
  consistency.<note n="*" place="foot"> Ensign Essuan was horsewhipped a few days afterwards by one of the

<p><hi rend="sc">Edward Bentinck</hi> was not kept above two or three days in
suspense as to the effect of the information which he had communicated
to the colonial government upon his late neighbour, although they were
two or three days of the greatest anxiety and uneasiness he had ever
experienced in his life; nor was the state of his mind much improved
when he heard that Mr. Cotton had been apprehended and brought to
town as the consignee of the cargo of Africans brought to him by
Monsieur Légere, and lodged in the criminal gaol, which was situated
within the garrison, and in fact formed a part of the fortress which
defended the town of Paramaribo.</p>
<pb n="131"/>
<p>Mr. Cotton, as was customary with opulent planters, in addition to his
plantation house, had also an establishment at Paramaribo, where he
sometimes resided for several months of the calender winter. In this
house his daughter, who, upon her father's apprehension, had attended
him to town for the sake of being near him and paying him daily visits,
was now residing; and the very next morning after Edward heard of her
arrival he called at the house, and (his heart almost audibly out-knocking
his hand) inquired if she was at home?</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir, she's at home,’ said one of her little black pages;
‘but’- with a look of reproach that said more emphatically than any
words could have done - ‘<hi rend="i">you</hi> are the last person that can ever again
be welcome here.’</p>
<p>‘Is she ill then?’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘No, massa, not ill, but sick in heart a little,’ replied Lucy.</p>
<p>‘Take her this card will you, Lucy,’ said Edward, ‘and say that
the gentleman whose name is upon it, requests the honour of an
interview.’</p>
<p>‘Missy says that you must excuse her,’ said the messenger
returning in a few minutes, ‘she cannot see you, sir.’</p>
<p>Edward Bentinck now perceived as he walked 
<pb n="132"/>
ponderingly home, that he was considered as the original and sole instigator of
the arrest of the slave captain and his accessories, and when he recollected how
many probable enemies the opinions and principles which he had avowed and
maintained had already occasioned him, who would be but too happy to turpify
the character of the step he had taken, by the use of every epithet and
expression which conveyed a shade of moral insinuation - such English
unpatriotic opinions! such fanatical hypocrisy! such gratuitous officiousness!
such ungrateful duplicity! they would exclaim - he could not but feel that his
conscientious obedience to the duties of humanity, had exposed to irretrievable
ruin the fondest wishes of his heart, and all those distant imaginary, yet dear
deluding structures of hope, which an uncorrupted heart of twenty-five <hi rend="i">will</hi>
build of paradisiacal materials, came tumbling about his ears. In this situation
he resolved however, to persist in seeking some opportunity of pleading his
case before Matilda, by disclosing as much of the real fact as he could without
endangering his informant, and the course of reflection and conscientious
feeling of paramount duty which led him to become the medium of such
informant's communication to the colonial government, as he thought himself
sure, that if she would 
<pb n="133"/>
but allow him to explain his motives in many of which he knew she would
concur, they must at least extenuate his conduct in her opinion. Accordingly, in
the course of a few days, he learned the hour in which it was customary for
Matilda to visit her father in the prison within the fort; and upon one of these
occasions on her leaving the prison, he presented himself to her and respectfully
requested the honour of attending her home.</p>
<p>‘This is persecution, sir!’ said Matilda, ‘do not avail yourself of
my father's present melancholy situation, occasioned as we are
informed by yourself, to interrupt me in the discharge of my daily duties
and affection towards him.’</p>
<p>‘If I were not certain,’ said Edward, ‘that Miss Cotton was under
a misapprehension, I would not have exposed myself to so severe a
charge from her, I only entreat permission to explain some of the
appearances against me.’</p>
<p>‘I cannot hear you sir,’ said Matilda, ‘I cannot with propriety
hear a vindication of his conduct from any gentleman, who is in no way
accountable to me for it.’</p>
<p>‘But is it consistent with Christian justice even, much less Christian
charity,’ said Edward, ‘to condemn any one unheard? and must I
innocently lose a good opinion I so much value without 
<pb n="134"/>
an opportunity being afforded me of exculpation?’</p>
<p>‘I entreat you to leave me, sir,’ said Matilda, ‘I dare not
continue the conversation, I have promised my father I would not permit
you to renew your visits without his consent, and it would be inhuman at
present even to mention to him a subject of so much irritation.’</p>
<p>‘Only then,’ said Edward, ‘let me implore Miss Cotton to
suspend her own judgment for the present, and I will forbear to solicit
the indulgence of exchanging another word with her.’</p>
<p>‘My judgment,’ said Matilda, rather softened, would rejoice to
acquit any one of whom I had ever thought so well as I confess I have
done of Mr. Bentinck, I could almost have pledged my own faith for the
sincerity and security of his, but do not mistake me, sir, or overrate the
value of my judgment, it can <hi rend="i">never</hi> be of any consequence to you, I must
again beg you to leave me, Mr. Bentinck! I cannot ask you in.’</p>
<p>‘After knowing your promise to Mr. Cotton,’ said Edward, ‘I
would not, without your permission, put my foot over the threshold to
save my life, I will not even ask you any more to acquit me, but do not
repel my dependance on your charity, for a few weeks at least not to
condemn --.’</p>
<pb n="135"/>
<p>‘Good morning to you, sir,’ said Matilda, as she entered her
house, ‘I would not have my father know that I have allowed myself
even the conversation which has just passed with you.’</p>
<p>Upon the whole Edward was not greatly relieved by this conversation
from his depression, for although where any real wish exists in the
breast of the judge for the innocence of the accused, exculpation is
comparatively easy, yet this could be the case with only one of his
judges, and supposing he could ever succeed in convincing Miss Cotton
of the propriety of his conduct, or at least of the honesty of his motives,
what chance had he of overcoming the resentment of her father, who
was undeniably the sufferer from it? He did not return home therefore
after leaving Miss Cotton, but continued in a state of rather melancholy
abstraction, to wander about the savannahs adjoining the town, and
from thence strayed almost unconsciously through an umbrageous
single path for four or five miles into the bush or wood, till he came to a
small cleared area of cultivation, belonging to an old Indian known by the
name of Pannana, who lived there with his wife and family in a little
thatched cabin of his own construction, under the shade of his own
plantains, interspersed with small fields of rice of his own cultivation, and
<pb n="136"/>
without the circle of his little farm, peninsulated from the rest of the world by
interminable and impervious forests. The deep seclusion and seeming repose of
the spot as Edward approached it affected him, and he could not help
ejaculating, ‘O God! for such an impenetrable home, with an adapted
constitution, and one adored and devoted companion, looking with me
through the moral vista of revelation, (or even the hopes of natural
religion undisturbed by any option of light or consequent misgiving for
having rejected it,) to the renovation and perfection of our being, and the
eternal production of all the delightful sanctimonies of our earthly
connexion in a still better world! would not every advantage past,
present, and prospective, which I derive from what is called civilization
and European refinement, be well exchanged?’</p>
<p>The old man was sitting under the colonnade, which is always formed
in the Indian and negro cabins by the projection of the thatch, with a little
granddaughter of three or four years old upon his knee. ‘Are you a
Christian, my friend?’ said Edward.</p>
<p>‘No! massa! me no Christian,’ replied Pannana.</p>
<p>‘But why, living so near Paramaribo, do you 
<pb n="137"/>
not send your children to school there, to learn Christianity and general
knowledge out of the white man's book?’</p>
<p>‘Christianity is no good, massa,’ said Pannana, ‘Christianity
make them good for nothing. Christians have all our faults, massa, and
many modes and practices of theft, falsehood, treachery, and cruelty,
which we disdain.’</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Edward, ‘you must see that the Christians have so
much more knowledge than you have, which contributes to the
enjoyment of life, I wonder you do not think it worth while to take some
pains to acquire it?’</p>
<p>‘True, massa,’ said Pannana; ‘but knowledge, a tree which
bears two fruits, the one a slow and deadly poison, but delicious, and
the other good for dressy (curing) the heart, but bad for taste, massa.
Which you think children eat most of, if you send them to the tree?’</p>
<p>‘But God Almighty,’ said Edward, ‘many hundred years ago
sent his own Son into the world to instruct all men, white, black, and red,
in their duty, and commanded us all to attend to his instructions, on pain
of his eternal displeasure.’</p>
<p>‘And do you really believe,’ said the Indian, ‘that we and our
forefathers are all, as you would teach us, condemned to suffer eternal
torments in 
<pb n="138"/>
another world, because we have not been taught your mysterious novelties? Are
we not the work of God? And can the Almighty not manifest his will without
the help of a book? If this is true, and God is just, then how is it consistent with
his justice to force life upon us without our consent, and then to condemn us to
eternal damnation, because we did not meet with you? No, massa, we are
convinced that the Christians are more depraved in morals than we Indians, if
we may judge of their doctrines by the general badness of their
  lives.’<note n="*" place="foot"> Stedman, vol. i. chap. xv. p. 382.</note></p>
<p>‘God condemns only for the rejection of light,’ said Edward, ‘he
will not punish you for not meeting with Christians; but, having met with
them, for neglecting to avail yourselves of the opportunity of learning his
will through them; as you know very well that what the Christians tell you
of loving and fearing God, and doing as he bids you, because you love
and fear him, and obeying his next and second great commandment, to
love your neighbour as yourself, and do to others as you would have
others do to you, is all true, because God assures you that it is so by his
own direct palaver with your own heart.’</p>
<pb n="139"/>
<p>‘Massa,’ said Pannana, ‘what Christians say, very true and
good; what Christians do, very false and bad; which we believe, massa?
our fathers always talkee Christians were devils, massa! Christians hunt
'em - Christians shoot 'em - Christians make slave of 'em;’ then
stamping with his foot, with great indignation, ‘this,’ said he, ‘not
your country, massa? - this my country? - this my father's country, till
Christians come and rob us of all, massa?’</p>
<p>‘I did not mean to offend you,’ said Edward, ‘I thought, as you
live so near the Christians, you might probably be upon better terms with
them.’</p>
<p>‘No, massa, you no offend me,’ said Pannana, ‘you seem good
massa, and talk kindly to poor Indian, and me no talk of Christians that
live now, massa; some of whom are come more bettra, massa, since
they knew us, and we not all good neither, massa; there are bad
Indians, as well as good Christians. But you know what they now call
  Oroocoocoo Snake,<note n="*" place="foot"> The most deadly reptile in creation perhaps.</note> massa! O, ougree, massa! If you touch him,
he kill you; our fathers used to call him <hi rend="i">Christian</hi>, massa!’</p>
<p>Edward feeling that proselytism to any extent against such strong
traditional prepossessions,

strengthened by the vicious habits and example of almost every nominal

thought it in vain to pursue the conversation; and, therefore, after tasting some
  of Pannana's palm wine,<note n="*" place="foot"> This wine is obtained from a particular species of the palm-tree, by
    merely boring a hole in the trunk at the proper season, and making a fire round

he might, perhaps, repeat his visit, which the old man said he should consider as
a promise, he took his leave.</p>
<p>But between the propagation of Christianity, the difficulties of
maintaining his own Christian consistency, the obstacles to the
prosecution of the wishes nearest his heart, and which, although a few
months ago, he thought himself quite proof against, were now daily
acquiring a more uncontroulable ascendancy; the hot-water in which he
had involved himself with the governor, and the collision of almost all his
opinions with those of his military companions, so completely absorbed
his attention, that he somehow or another took a 
<pb n="141"/>
wrong turn, which only led him more deeply into the wood, from which, when
it became quite dark, he found it impossible to extricate himself till the next
morning.</p>
<p>The day had fortunately been a dry one, and from a gun-flint and a
knife, which he happened to carry about him, having made a blazing fire,
he passed the night better than he expected; but the next morning, on
his arrival at the garrison, from anxiety of mind and the extreme
noxiousness in such a latitude of the heavy dews and vapours, and
occasional rains to which he had been exposed without shelter all the
night, he was soon seized with the symptoms of violent fever and ague,
and conveyed immediately to the officers' ward in the hospital.</p>
<p>For eight or ten days his fever increased rapidly, till it reached its
climax, producing considerable inflammation of the brain; but yet, except
in intervals of actual delirium, from the agony it occasioned him, Edward
Bentinck did not lose his self-possession; but, after the fever was
abated, so rapid had been the complete prostration of his strength, and
such was the extreme state of his exhaustion, that he could not stand a
minute upon his feet without fainting, and he lay for many nights
apprehensive of removal before morning to the other world from 
<pb n="142"/>
cramp or spasms in the stomach; during this time the great question of the truth
or falsehood of the religious impressions in which he had been educated could
not but press anxiously upon his mind, he reviewed all the evidences that he
could think of, both for and against their divine origin, and the former seemed
to gain both light and weight as his approach towards death and disengagement
from external objects threw the latter more and more into the distance, and as
the influence of his senses subsided, the unselfish benignity of the spirit of
Christianity and the beauty of its spotless holiness carried stronger and stronger
conviction to his unsophisticated heart, that such a religion could not be of
earth, or as every thing must partake of the spirit and nature of its origin, it must
have been more earthly. The composure arising from such an anchor of his soul
in its utmost emergency and the increasing confidence in its sufficiency, which
he derived from every examination, contributed materially to prevent a fatal
issue to his fever; but it was many days before he could leave his bed or walk
across the room, and weeks before he began to recruit his strength sufficiently
to think of resuming his military duties, and would have been much longer, but
for a little incident, of the effect of which the medicines and diet got all 
<pb n="143"/>
the credit, but which, in fact, was of more service than both together.</p>
<p>Edward happened one day, at the commencement of his
convalescence, to be standing near the door of the ward, which was a
little ajar, when he thought he heard a voice he was acquainted with,
saying to the nurse, as she approached the ward -</p>
<p>‘Missy bid me <hi rend="i">tell you</hi>,’ (Negro idiom) ‘how is Mr. Bentinck?’</p>
<p>‘Who is your mistress?’ said the nurse, ‘I never answer
inquiries unless I know from whom they come.’</p>
<p>‘Missy no let me say datty,’ replied the messenger.</p>
<p>‘Well then, you may go back to your mistress, and tell her what I
say.’</p>
<p>Which the messenger accordingly did.</p>
<p>‘Was any one inquiring after me, nurse?’ said Edward, when she
entered the room.</p>
<p>‘A little girl, sir; but as she would not tell me who sent her, I sent her
away; but she will be here again presently, I have no doubt, as she
seemed very reluctant to go back without an answer. Would you like to
see her, sir, when she returns?’</p>
<p>‘No, on no account,’ said Edward, ‘as her mistress does not
wish that I should know her, 
<pb n="144"/>
and if I should have seen the messenger before, the former would, perhaps,
learn that she was discovered; but, if she calls again, I wish you would speak to
her just outside the door, and leave it a little open, that I may try and distinguish
the voice.’</p>
<p>In a few minutes a tap at the door summoned the nurse out of the
room, who beckoned to Edward to follow her to the door, where he soon
heard the same voice say,</p>
<p>‘Missy say she cannot tell you her name; but she bid me give you
this,’ offering the nurse some money, ‘and beg you to send her an
answer to her inquiry?’</p>
<p>‘Mr. Bentinck,’ said the nurse, taking the douceur, ‘is rather
better, but it is tedious slow work, in this climate, recovering from such
an attack as his; if there had not been some strong secret hope in his
heart of something for him to live for, he must have sunk under such a
fever, like the poor gentlemen on the beds on each side of him, and they
have not either of them many days to live, I am sure.’</p>
<p>‘Thank ye,’ said Lucy, whose voice Edward now distinctly
recognised, and off she flew with her message.</p>
<p>From that moment the convalescence of the 
<pb n="145"/>
patient, who was the object of such an interest, became decisive, whilst the
declension of strength of his two companions, to whom the nurse alluded, and
of whom I will now give some account, was daily more obvious.</p>
<p>I will just observe first, however, that the issue of fevers in the West
Indies depends almost entirely upon the state of the mind, and I cannot
see why, from this and many other notorious instances of mental
influence on material complaints, one might not as well contend for the
non-existence of matter, as to adopt the reasoning of Mr. Lawrence and
other sceptical anatomists, and contend, from the occasional influence
of matter over mind, for the non-existence of the latter.</p>
<p>One of Edward's next neighbours, in the ward, was a young
Hanoverian, who had been a Lieutenant in the German Legion, in the
British service; but being reduced at the peace, had entered the service
of Bolivar, where, besides his rations, he got literally nothing but hard
blows and broken promises - never a stiver of pay - and his lodgings and
clothing were always of the worst, and most scanty description; he soon,
therefore, quitted that service in disgust, and from his acquaintance with
an Hanoverian officer of rank in the Netherlands army, then
commanding the troops in Surinam, 
<pb n="146"/>
he came there upon the medical staff, for which he had been originally
educated; but dissatisfaction with his present circumstances and slow prospect
of promotion, although quite a young man, concurred with the malaria of the
climate to reduce him to his present condition. He was a determined materialist;
he professed, indeed, a sort of belief in a God, but derided the doctrine of a
particular Providence, and laughed at the idea of his being accessible to prayer,
or suspending for a moment the operation of those laws of matter to which he
had, somehow or other, irrevocably committed the world: in fact, for any
purpose of consolation to himself or value to human society, he might just as
well have been an absolute Atheist.</p>
<p>‘Oh, sir, I am a miserable man,’ said he one day to Edward, ‘I
want to write a letter, and I have not strength.’</p>
<p>‘Be composed,’ said Edward, ‘and to-morrow, perhaps, you will
be able.’</p>
<p>‘To-morrow, sir!’ cried he with vehemence; ‘You do not know
what you are talking about. The doctor told me to-day - yes, he did, that I
should not live till to-morrow. May God Almighty prove him a liar! Why
did he not tell me the real state of my case sooner? Well, when I am
dead, I hope my corpse will bring a plague upon 
<pb n="147"/>
the house, and infect every one that comes near it. May every Dutchman and
Spaniard that meets my burial in the street drop down dead, and be eternally
damned! I have served them both, and do not know which are the greatest
rascals! I was at Schimmelpinninck's funeral the other day - the coffin was
hardly big enough to hold him, and what a burying-place! The coffins are all
piled one above another, and their corners stick through the ground - the carrion
vultures flew about as if they were glad to see us in our black clothes. I'll be
laid there by and by - Lord help me! But I must write that letter!’</p>
<p>‘You cannot write in your present state of agitation,’ said Edward,
‘would it not compose you to read a chapter in the Bible, or let me
read one to you?’</p>
<p>‘That's all d--d humbug sir; all imposture and jugglery, you may
depend upon it. Not that I ever examined the subject quite as much as I
ought; but it is too late, now this accursed fever has moored me fast,
and death will soon explain to me the grand secret, without the trouble of
my examining the question at all. But I must write that letter! I have
something on my mind which I would not disclose; but I had rather the
whole world should know it, than that I should die, and 
<pb n="148"/>
when that's off my mind, it may perhaps relieve me. Is there no help? Is there
no power in physic? Oh, it would be nothing to be shot in battle! - nothing to
founder at sea! - nothing compared with dying in this gloomy deliberate way.
Oh, this accursed climate; and yet it is so natural for a man to love his country,
that I should not be surprised to hear one of these amphibious frogs of
Dutchmen say, that this infernal steam-kettle of an atmosphere, was the finest
  climate in the world.’ <note n="*" place="foot"> See Adventure at the Havanna, published in Blackwood. - <hi rend="i">Note by the
    Author</hi>.</note></p>
<p>In this way he continued cursing the hour of his birth, and every object
and thing that surrounded him, till after a considerable intermission of his
execrations, Edward found, on addressing him, that he was dead.</p>
<p>Edward Bentinck's sick neighbour, on the other side of his bed, was a
young Englishman, of the name of Shelford, who had come out with him
from Europe, to look after a considerable property, which had devolved
on him by the death of a planter, nearly belated, in hopes of returning in
a few years with sufficient fortune to pursue an attachment, which he
had formed before he left England, to a girl of great beauty, as far as
could 
<pb n="149"/>
be judged from the miniature found upon his heart; but which, alas! ‘a
wealthless lot,’ had compelled him for a time to forego. He had been
moved into the military hospital on his seizure, in preference to
continuing in his own house, for the benefit of the advice and attentions
of the military medical staff, who were considered the most skilful
febricians in the colony. He was a delightful fellow, with a heart
responsive to every emotion of generosity - a perfect gentleman in short,
and incapable of being a blackguard. If the reader asks what <hi rend="i">is</hi> a
gentleman - and what <hi rend="i">is</hi> a blackguard? the definition, perhaps, will be
rather difficult, from the infinite number of shades of each of those
characters, which sometimes seem to approach almost to an identity;
but every one knows there is, in fact, as much difference between a
gentleman and a blackguard, as there is (if the reader will pardon for
once the use of an expressive vulgar proverb) ‘between a silk purse
and a sow's ear,’ and that you can never make one of the other. A
gentleman, amongst other characteristics, is, especially a man of good
faith, a man who sweareth to his neighbour and disappointeth him not,
although it were to his own hindrance, the very antipodes of the
personification of the spirit of law, a man who always binds himself by
the <hi rend="i">spirit</hi> and
<pb n="150"/>
never shelters himself from its demands under the <hi rend="i">letter</hi> of his engagements, a
man who would lose all his self-respect if he ever had recourse, from mercenary
or interested motives, to falsehood, subterfuge, equivocation, or deceit, a man
of perfect self-command and modest undogmatical manners, a man of urbanity,
benevolence, and equable courtesy to all, a man of obvious pride, but proud
only of his superiority to meanness, ever ready to make allowance for the
failings of others, but never of his own: the word Christian is the nearest to a
synonyme for gentleman; but Christian and gentleman are not convertible
terms, because there are many duties that belong to the consistency of each
character, which are not reciprocal. Christianity is in some of its aspects a
dispensation of such sublime and lofty mercy, that it seems beneath the
infinitude of its importance to dole out its bounties with rigid precision of
correspondence to the degrees of variance in the temporal character of its
disciples; it is not, therefore, for any human judgment to pronounce with what
inequality of progress and imperfection of consistency the sincere desire and
endeavour of conformity to its spirit may entitle any one to the glorious name,
and still more glorious death-conquering privileges of a Christian; there is
about a gentleman too a 
<pb n="151"/>
feeling of aristocracy of difficult reconciliation with the repulse of all
egotistical pretension and the uniform inculcation of self-abasement, which
pervade the doctrines of the cross, but where these two characters of gentleman
and Christian meet, or rather when the latter is engrafted on the former, they
constitute together the model of social excellence, the utmost perfection of
humanity; such was poor Shelford. He had since his arrival in Surinam been
misled occasionally into some of those irregularities which young unmarried
men for the most part, I am afraid, consider as quite venial, and practice without
scruple; but he had great misgivings about them, for his heart and principles
were as sound as a rock.</p>
<p>The morning after the death of the young German, he called Edward
close to his bed-side; ‘Bentinck!’ said he, ‘I have been in this
hospital once before, but I have never been quite so ill as I am now, and
the desperate departure of our poor companion, reminds me that I have
no time to lose in throwing myself upon the support of the religious
principles in which I have been most carefully and affectionately brought
up, for such is the agony I suffer, that it is impossible I can live many
days unless it abates. My mother has been long dead, but an excellent
aunt supplied her 
<pb n="152"/>
place in confirming upon my heart the strong religious impressions that are
interwoven there with the remembrance of my dear mother's affection. We
have, I believe, both of us been educated in the same faith, for I have often
heard you express your confidence in the truth of Christianity, will you allow
me to go over with you some points of its evidences?’ Upon Edward's
assenting and drawing a chair close to his head, ‘look,’ said he
putting out his furred and swollen tongue to shew the fury of the raging
fever that was consuming him, and pressing Edward's hand on his
burning forehead, ‘I feel as if my brain was burning to a cinder
between two fires, I therefore want no argument to convince me of the
existence of evil, and moral evil must have preceded physical, now to
suppose that a being who had not strength to retain the upright moral
posture of his creation, should be able to recover and maintain it after
being crippled by a fall, without some such preternatural interposition of
his maker as that which Christianity explains to us, seems to me an
absolute absurdity, do you think so Bentinck?’</p>
<p>‘Indeed I do,’ said Edward; ‘I have no other hope for myself but
in the great atonement of the death of Christ, and the silent and
<hi rend="i">generally</hi> gradual but not the less preternatural influence of 
<pb n="153"/>
God's spirit upon the hearts of those who earnestly and perseveringly implore
it, purchased for them by that atonement.’</p>
<p>‘Well then,’ said Shelford, ‘the only other question is the mode
of availing ourselves of it. I see clearly,’ said he, ‘that I have
contracted some wrong habits, which nothing but such a sickness as
this would have given me resolution to break off, but which now if it
should please God to restore me, I am determined to overcome;
therefore, whether the issue of this sickness be life or death, I feel
satisfied that it has been sent to me in mercy, at the same time my life
has not been without trials and prevailing efforts to act right, but I
endeavour as much as I can to look out of myself altogether, and
confide exclusively in the mercy more adequately purchased by Christ's
blood, not’ said he emphatically, ‘that I am an Antinomian and
think human efforts of no consequence, far from it! but our best motives
are so mixed, that I feel now that I dare not trust to them; I feel no
resentments, but forgive from the bottom of my heart any who have
injured me, and am I trust in perfect charity with all men. I cannot say
that I have no wish to live, at my age the summer of life is all before me,
and I have brothers and sisters and many friends in England, besides 
<pb n="154"/>
my father whose partiality and constant kindness the thought of enjoying again
in this world is very delightful to me, and death in itself is an awful change to
any man of reflection, but I think I have courage to meet it, if it should so please
God, do you think I am in a proper state of mind to do so?’</p>
<p>‘You really make me envy you,’ said Edward, ‘your views of
your present situation altogether, and your belief in the truth and value of
Christianity seem so rational and manly.’</p>
<p>‘O! there I'm fixed,’ said he, with great energy, ‘I never
doubted! You know not how thankful I am now to my father and friends
for their discouragement in me of some opinions that seemed favourable
to infidelity.’</p>
<p>‘Shall I read to you,’ said Edward, ‘from the Bible, or any of the
prayers from the service of the church of England?’</p>
<p>‘I have them all by heart!’ said Shelford, ‘I have them all by
heart! No! leave me for the present, now as I am a little exhausted.’</p>
<p>After this Shelford said little till near midnight, when, having declined
any more medicine, and feeling his end approaching, he called Edward
and pressing his hand said, ‘Bentinck! you know my friends, its God's
will that I should die in exile, 
<pb n="155"/>
but I thank him that it is not without a witness to acquaint them that although
my life has not been faultless, my death did not disgrace their Christian
goodness and example. God bless you!’</p>
<p>These were his last words, and after a few convulsive respirations in
less than ten minutes he had entirely ceased to breathe. ‘Curse it! I
can't help it,’ said Edward as he turned from the bed-side sobbing
like an infant, ‘Christianity then does <hi rend="i">not</hi> always fail men at the hour of
death!!!’</p>
<p>I don't know what made Edward Bentinck swear unless it was at his
own sensibility, but as a mere narrator I am bound to tell the truth, he did
so; he had scarcely heard from Shelford a single expression of
impatience during his whole sickness, and nothing could exceed the
manly composure and calm fortitude with which he met his death: the
contrast between him and the young German naturally drew forth the
last part of the foregoing exclamation of Edward, and could not but make
on him the deepest and most salutary impression.</p>
<p>The following lines were found in Shelford's pocket book, they are not
perhaps his own, or if they are, they were not intended probably to
express his own feelings and circumstances, but were written from a
partial sympathy with those of some 
<pb n="156"/>
unhappy inmate of the same sick ward, with which he became acquainted on
some former occasion.</p>

<head>THE DYING EXILE.</head>
<l>I should like to have died in my birth-place,</l>
<l>In spite of my errors, perhaps, then</l>
<l>The affection of those who once lov'd me</l>

<l>Inscribed by my <hi rend="i">mother</hi>, there lay.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>The word seem'd to startle my ear;</l>
<l>Did <hi rend="i">I</hi> ever a mother embrace?</l>
<l>No! my heart said, else how came I here,</l>
<l>So contrasted the thought and the place.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>On the wall had I seen here another</l>
<l>Hand writing of God, as of yore,</l>

<l>It could scarcely have startled me more.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>

<l>The trials, with life only closing,</l>
<l>Which she'd borne a son to go through.</l>

<l>Which has charities closer and finer,</l>
<l>And sanctities still more sublime.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>To this I've too fondly aspired,</l>
<l>For this I've all dangers defied,</l>
<l>This the only reward I've desired,</l>
<l>And this gain'd, I could calmly have died.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>With this hope from frenzy to shield me,</l>
<l>Through all climes of the world could I roam,</l>
<l>Content, if at last it would yield me</l>
<l>The bliss of a personal home.</l>
<l>&nbsp;</l>
<l>But my gourd, like the prophet's, is wasted,</l>

<p><hi rend="sc">I Must</hi> now request my readers to return with me for a short time to Mr.
Cotton's plantation at Anne's Grove. On the arrest and removal of the
proprietor, Outalissi and the rest of the negroes were left under the joint
charge of Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Hogshead, a paradoxical arrangement; -
the impressions from every word and action of the one directly colliding
with the impressions from every word and action of the other, explosion
  <note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a006">See note F.</xref></note> must be the result. If Christianity is true, the planters will be the
authors and just victims of their infidel and obstinate interception of the
sun of righteousness from the souls of their dependants; if 
<pb n="160"/>
Christianity is only a cunningly devised fable, its propagators are justly
responsible for all consequences; but in the meantime, the pull-baker
pull-devil sort of effect, to which the missionary efforts are exposed here,
is at once destructive of the planters' authority, and derogatory of that of
Christianity, its only and best substitute. Religion, in the present day, in
order to afford any protection to the security and welfare of society by its
moral controul over its members, ‘must not,’ as Burke says, ‘be
banished to obscure corners, like something we are ashamed to show,
but must exalt her mitred front in courts and parliaments; she must mix
throughout the whole mass of life, and blend with all classes in
society.’ On the contrary, what is the case in Surinam?</p>
<p>‘Come to church and save your souls,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
  <p>‘Souls, souls, d--n your souls - grow tobacco,’<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a007">See note G</xref></note> said Mr.
Hogshead, ‘or woe betide your bodies.’</p>
<p>‘Renounce your lusts,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<p>‘O yes! cursed hypocrite, that you may have no rivalry in the
indulgence of yours,’ said Mr. Hogshead.</p>
<p>‘Seek the Lord whilst he may be found of you,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<pb n="161"/>
<p>‘You may seek long enough before you'll find him here,’ said Mr.
Hogshead.</p>
<p>‘Obey God rather than man,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<p>‘Fulfil your tasks, your daily tasks, or I'll soon show you that I am to
be obey'd first here,’ said Mr. Hogshead.</p>
<p>‘O! spare her! spare her!’ said Mr. Schwartz to the director as he
was superintending the flagellation of a pregnant negress; ‘remember
that with the same measure that you mete to others it shall be meted
unto you!’</p>
<p>‘Give her two dozen more for the parson's interference,’ said Mr.
Hogshead.</p>
<p>‘As you would that men should do unto you, do you even so unto
them,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>

<p>On the apprehension and removal of Mr. Cotton and his daughter to
the colonial capital, little Charles Cotton was left at Anne's Grove for the
sake of his health, the temperature of the atmosphere on the coast
being three or four degrees lower than at Paramaribo, and the bracing
effect of the sea air making it to most Creoles, and in-
 <pb n="162"/>
deed to many Europeans, both an agreeable and salubrious climate. One of this
child's attendants was a little girl of about fifteen, of the name of Charlotte
Venture. She belonged to a tribe of negroes rather rare in Surinam, but not at all
uncommon, as I have been informed, in the neighbouring colony of Demarara,
distinguished for the symmetry of their forms, and the almost Grecian cast of
their features, instead of the squab nose and thick lips which it is difficult for
European prejudice to dissociate from a negro countenance. She had a fine
strait nose, small mouth, thin lips, teeth that seemed to vie with the eyes in
giving light and life to the expression of the whole countenance, a small
slightly-prominent laughing chin in quick and intimate unison with the lines of
the mouth; - eyes of a chastised intelligence and beaming benevolence, almost
as much beyond the comparatively inanimate expression of a frigid zone
beauty, in warmth, vivacity, and penetration, as her own never-sullen summer-lavishing sun beyond his captious wintry rival, set off too by long silken raven
lashes; and corresponding hair (not wool), and a fine glossy jet black skin that
looked like polished marble.</p>
<p>It was not likely that such a girl should escape the lascivious observation of
Mr. Hogshead; but 
<pb n="163"/>
she was a remarkably good girl, well instructed in Christianity, and a great
favourite of her young mistress, and for a long time, therefore, he was
compelled to confine his persecution to his eyes. But poor Charlotte, from
having frequently heard her mistress advert to it with expressions of sympathy,
imbibed a very natural interest in the history of Outalissi, and undertook with
great alacrity a commission from her on leaving home (in which the latter
possibly had some speculation of temporal as well as spiritual benevolence in
view, for which I have no doubt the saints in heaven will pardon her; although I
am by no means equally confident of pardon from either their friends or
enemies on earth,) to endeavour, if she had any opportunity, to remove some of
the unhappy captive's prejudices against Christianity, and convince him that
those from whose conduct he judged of the doctrines of Christianity were the
opprobrium and disgrace of their profession, and no more really deserved the
name of Christians from the accidental circumstance of their education in a
Christian country, than a progeny of the wolves and tigers of his native forests
would deserve that name, from a mere local removal. Charlotte, however, did
not make much progress in the conversion of her royal pupil.</p>
<pb n="164"/>
  <p>‘<hi rend="i">She</hi> convinced him,’ he said, ‘that a <hi rend="i">soi-disant</hi><note n="*" place="foot"> I have already said that I have taken the liberty occasionally of
    assisting the perspicuity of Outalissi's language a little, but never of altering the
    sentiment. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Author</hi>.</note>
Christian might be both good and lovely, but he could not tell how much
of her goodness to ascribe to Christianity, and how much to the kindly
elements of her own natural disposition; that the proportion of good
nominal Christians being so very small, was rather a presumption of
their being good <hi rend="i">in spite</hi> of Christian influence than in subjection to it.’</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Charlotte, ‘if what your own heart confesses to be
good in any body corresponds exactly with the directions of Christ, you
must in consistency confess those directions to be good also.’</p>
<p>‘What are those directions?’ said Outalissi.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Schwartz will explain that to you,’ said Charlotte, ‘if you will
listen to him with attention, which therefore Missy begs you to do,’
and which finally Charlotte obtained a promise from him that he would.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if Outalissi did not derive religious conviction from
Charlotte's arguments, he imbibed the sentiment that ranks the next in
its elevating and refining influence upon every human 
<pb n="165"/>
bosom - a sentiment to which, when it comprises the association of mental
purity as well as bodily <hi rend="i">worshipfulness</hi> (to use an expression of the Liturgy) in
its object, and without both of which it is not the complete thing that God and
nature intended it should be, philosophy itself must ascribe a very high degree
of respectability, viz. a sentiment of strong personal affection for his
instructress. Not that his manly principles ever betrayed such feelings to
Charlotte either by look or gesture; ‘for never,’ said he to himself,
‘shall Outalissi be the father of a race of slaves;’ and his actual
circumstances precluded all hope of any honourable result to such a
passion; which, however, notwithstanding his perception of its utter
hopelessness, and his conscientious concealment of it in consequence,
did somehow or another (as perhaps had been anticipated by his
mistress) considerably soothe his irritation, and gradually beguile him of
his impatience of the indignity of his condition. Neither did Charlotte,
who knew well from the frequent experience of her mistress's
benevolence, that she could have handsomely and virtuously provided
for them both, and probably had some such intention, remain long
insensible to the very near connexion between pity and love, and instead
of always waiting for an opportunity she would 
<pb n="166"/>
sometimes make one by walking with her little charge in the ground where
Outalissi was employed (although frequently forbidden by Mr. Hogshead) for
the pleasure of engaging him in conversation.</p>
<p>‘How often must I tell you not to interrupt that sulky fellow in his
work,’ said Mr. Hogshead to her as he overtook her returning from
one of these debates.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Charlotte whose heart beat with apprehension at the
approach of the white monster, ‘I was only trying as my mistress
directed me to persuade him to become a Christian, and attend Mr.
Schwartz, because my mistress says that his instruction in Christianity is
the only compensation she can make him for the terrible injustice and
injuries that have been done him.’</p>
<p>‘So your mistress means to compensate him with Christianity, and
you with something better, eh! Charlotte! but come,’ said the director
chucking her under the chin, ‘don't be such a fool as to throw yourself
away upon a slave when you know very well that I have long designed
you for myself, and I am not much accustomed to disappointment in the
accomplishment of my purposes.’</p>
<p>‘I would rather remain as I am for ever, sir,’ 
<pb n="167"/>
said Charlotte, ‘than be so ungrateful to my misstress as to dispose of
myself without her consent, and I am sure she would not hear of my
compliance with your proposals.’</p>
<p>‘Your mistress and you too are a couple of hypocritical puritans, I
must have you without her consent then, that's all my dear,’ said the
hideous reptile with a characteristic grin that made poor Charlotte
tremble from head to foot, at the same time putting his arm round her
waist. ‘You'd better consent to live with me quietly,’ continued he,
‘or if you compel me to have recourse to violence, I dare say I shall
find an opportunity of taking some of that disdain out of you before you
are again within the reach of your mistress's protection.’</p>
<p>‘Oh!’ said Charlotte, ‘pray release me sir, and let me speak to
Mr. Schwartz.’</p>
<p>‘No! no! curse Mr. Schwartz,’ said Mr. Hogshead, ‘there's no
time like the present after all, promise your consent now, or you shall not
stir till I have indulged my desire.’</p>
<p>‘No! sir, I would sooner die,’ said Charlotte.</p>
<p>‘Then take the consequences of your own obstinacy,’ said the
white savage throwing her upon the ground, but a scream from little
Charles 
<pb n="168"/>
Cotton brought up Outalissi, the reach and quickness of whose eye and ear were
about three times those of a European, and who had been watching every word
and motion through some intervening foliage, and in a few seconds Mr.
Hogshead felt himself in Outalissi's powerful grasp, as feeble as a child in the
hands of a giant. ‘Now, sir,’ said Outalissi, ‘if you call for
assistance, or utter a single word till that poor daughter of my unhappy
race has reached the house, it shall be the last you will ever utter, for I
will put my foot upon your neck till I press the breath out of your body,
and you know it will not be in the feeble strength of your diseased and
bloated carcase to disengage yourself, although all your limbs are
loose.’ Mr. Hogshead knew too well the manly temper of the nerve
that bound him, to doubt the instant execution of this threat if he
betrayed the least resistance. His victim for the present therefore was
soon out of his power, and when Outalissi saw that she had reached the
house, ‘if now I let you go,’ said he to Mr. Hogshead, ‘before to-morrow my back will bear bloody evidence of your Christian gratitude,
good faith, and promise keeping. Here we are at the edge of the sea,
without the possibility of any detection, for there is no eye but that of the
great spirit over us, and to rid the 
<pb n="169"/>
world of such a walking lazar house, such a pest of moral putridity as you, must
be an agreeable service to Him, why should I not now discharge a part of my
deep, deep debt of vengeance by giving you up to the mercy of that shark there,
whose most Christian countenance of cold, watery, pitiless eyes, and blood
guzzling snout, just shows itself above the gentle ripple of the shallowing
waves, as if sent especially for the occasion.’</p>
<p>‘O, spare me! spare me! noble Outalissi,’ said the abject paltry
tyrant, falling on his knees, and embracing those of him whose manly
form in every line displayed the stamp of natural superiority, ‘and I will
swear by my God, or by your God, or by any God, to be eternally grateful
to you: and, far from punishing, to reward you in every way I can, and be
of all the service to you in my power. O! remember, good Outalissi! that
although the Christians' conduct to you has been outrageously wicked,
their ill treatment is only co-extensive with your life, but if you now take
mine, you will consign me to eternal damnation. O! give me some time to
repent at least, good Outalissi!’</p>
<p>‘There's sense in that,’ said Outalissi, ‘I confess; for I do
believe there's something in my 
<pb n="170"/>
breast which tells me that nothing but damnation in the next world can await
such as you, Christian or heathen; but now I release you, don't suppose that you
deceive me - you will neither repent, or forbear your vengeance; but still,’
said he thoughtfully, ‘for once at least I will show that I can practise
what the Christians only preach about, viz. the duty of returning good for
evil, and leaving vengeance to Him whose all-including eye can best
dispense it. - Go.’</p>
<p>It may be easily supposed that Outalissi got nothing for his
magnanimity but a most tremendous flogging that same evening, and
poor Charlotte was so frightened that she prevailed on Mr. Schwartz to
write to her mistress, acquainting her with what had happened, and
intreating permission that she should come to her in town, which no
doubt, under such circumstances, would have been arranged by her
mistress, if she had not requested it; but before an answer could be
received to Mr. Schwartz's letter an unfortunate accident threw her still
more completely into the director's power. She was thanking Outalissi
one morning for his generous rescue, and condoling with him on his
punishment, and the misery of being subject to the despotism of such a
monster, and saying, 
<pb n="171"/>
‘that she hoped on her mistress being acquainted with his conduct
that she would prevail on her father to discharge him.’</p>
<p>‘O! they're all alike,’ said Outalissi. ‘As for me his lashes
cannot reach my soul, and therefore on my account, Charlotte, don't you
inflame either his vengeance or odious passion against yourself. I thank
both you and that sweet Christian flower, your young mistress, for the
interest you take in my misfortunes; and if poor Outalissi's life, which is
all that is left him, can at any time be of service to either of you, I hope at
least to be one evidence, by the cheerfulness with which I should
expend it, that our dark bosoms, Charlotte, can harbour gratitude as well
as vengeance.’</p>
<p>‘You have already shown that to me,’ said Charlotte.</p>
<p>‘O! that,’ said Outalissi, ‘was nothing more than I would have
done for any other in similar danger; but you must not, Charlotte, come
so much within the reach of this white atheist, for I may not be always
near you. Keep near the house: he is already chafed to fury by your
escape from him, and has forbidden the slaves to attend Mr. Schwartz
any more of a Sunday, and punished several severely for disobeying
him, on pretence that he, Mr. Schwartz, has taught you to deride 
<pb n="172"/>
his authority; but they declare they will persist at all hazards, and have invited
me to join them, which I think I shall, for by the same light, and exactly in the
same proportion that Mr. Schwartz shows them the duty of patience, gentleness,
goodness, truth, temperance, justice, mercy, or in one word, which implies all
goodness, charity towards each other, and the deepest feeling of self-abasement
and humility towards God, he shows them also in colours deriving from the
contrast a strength and depth of which many of them before had but very faint,
inadequate, and undefined impressions, the full extent and number of the
burning, burning wrongs which they have received from man, and in that
light,’ said Outalissi, ‘although I am not yet a Christian, <hi rend="i">I</hi> see a
hope of vengeance.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’ said Charlotte. ‘O, do not listen to any
scheme of violence, much less suggest one; believe me, the white
people are both too strong and too cunning to make any effectual
resistance of them possible; for, even, if, by surprise, you could master
them for a moment, they have at all times indefinite supplies of force at
their command from their countries across the sea.’</p>
<p>Before Outalissi could reply to the last observation, Charlotte screamed
violently, and fainted, on
<pb n="173"/>
seeing little Charles Cotton, who had been playing about, only a hundred
yards from her, at Outalissi's back, in the mouth of a tremendous tiger,
that by a sudden spring from the bush had caught him by the loose part
  of his trowsers, and throwing him diagonally across his back,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a009">See Note I.</xref></note> was
slyly slinking off with him. What was to be done? Outalissi had no fire-arms, and merely a short coarse cutlass, with which he had been cutting
grass. To pursue the tiger, even if he could have overtaken him, and the
child was not already dead, would infallibly occasion his being torn to
pieces by increasing the speed of the animal's retreat through the
bushes. There was but one chance, which would have occurred to no
one that had not the heart of a lion, and been accustomed from his
boyhood almost to rival one in exertions of muscular elasticity and
power, and prepared if necessary personally to encounter one. It was to
rush through the bush, which would conceal him from the tiger, and
throw himself directly across his path, a near point of which, by the help
of his cutlass, he was enabled to reach before the formidable felon; -
where, as he expected, having laid himself down at his full length, and
absolutely without motion, as if he were dead, in less than a minute the
tiger trotted 
<pb n="174"/>
slowly over him with his prey in his mouth; but without betraying the slightest
inclination to run any risk of losing that, by examining another, apparently
already dead. Accordingly, when Outalissi, laying across the <hi rend="i">length</hi> of the tiger,
saw himself between his legs, by a violent spring at the exact moment, when it
could alone have availed, he threw his body with tremendous force across the
tiger's back, which compelled him to drop his prey, and brought him to the
ground, when kneeling across his neck and shoulders, Outalissi soon dispatched
him with his cutlass, but not without some severe lacerations from his hind
claws.</p>
<p>Charles Cotton did not appear to be the least hurt, as the animal had
merely held him by his clothes; he had probably fainted immediately
after his seizure, and just began to awake from his change of position
and cessation of movement, as, when Outalissi took him up, he looked
wild and staring, and scarcely seemed to know what had happened to
him; but shortly afterwards he fell into fits, and for a long time he never
seemed easy out of his preserver's arms.</p>
<p>When Outalissi returned to Charlotte (who had but just begun to revive,
for the whole transaction scarcely occupied ten minutes), himself all
covered 
<pb n="175"/>
and streaming with blood, and her young master in his arms, looking as if he
had been snatched out of a coffin, she fell back again into a state of
insensibility. Outalissi, therefore, taking her up in one arm whilst he held the
child in the other, with about the same ease that one could lift a fowling piece,
carried them both into the house.</p>
<p>Mr. Hogshead did not fail to avail himself of the pretence afforded by
this unfortunate occurrence for prosecuting his designs against his
helpless victim; he wrote a full account of the matter to his master, Mr.
Cotton, taking care to magnify as much as possible Charlotte's
imprudence, and ascribed the accident entirely to her neglect and
disregard of his repeated injunctions not to come upon that ground,
(although, from the boldness of these animals, it might have happened
just as well any where else,) and concluding that he had been obliged to
send Outalissi to the hospital, and had thought it right to punish
Charlotte till Mr. Cotton's pleasure should be known, by locking her up in
  a part of his own house;<note n="*" place="foot"> The directors upon the plantation have generally a house detached from
    that of the proprietor. - <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</note> and that he had transferred Master
Charles to the care of another slave.</p>
<p>The next morning, which happened to be Sun-
<pb n="176"/>
day, Mr. Schwartz called as usual to pursue the Christian instruction of the
negroes, who told him that the director had ordered them not to attend, because,
he said, Charlotte Venture had referred to his instructions to justify her
insolence to him; but that they were resolved to attend in spite of him or his
master either, and asked Mr. Schwartz, if he did not think they were right?</p>
<p>‘I think,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘that it will very likely expose you to
a gauntlet of persecution and punishment, and, perhaps, even death, if
you do; but,’ continued he firmly, ‘I think you <hi rend="i">are</hi> right.’</p>
<p>‘Massa, if we die, we go to God; we <hi rend="i">loby</hi> (love) to die, massa. This
life no more bettra as Hell, massa?’</p>
<p>‘But, perhaps,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘you may as well forbear to
exasperate the director for the present, as I will write to Mr. Cotton, and
he may possibly relieve us from his controul.’ After visiting Outalissi
in the hospital, from the account which he received from him, Mr.
Schwartz desired to see Charlotte Venture.</p>
<p>‘Why do you hesitate,’ said he to Mr. Hogshead; ‘you surely
have no fear of her making any disclosure to your prejudice?’</p>
<p>‘Disclosure!’ said Mr. Hogshead, ‘O, no! 
<pb n="177"/>
she must be past disclosure of any sort by this time, as I left her dying an hour
ago.’</p>
<p>‘There is the more reason that I should see her,’ said Mr.
Schwartz, ‘in order to ascertain the cause of her death, that I may
explain it to her kind mistress, as you know the value she sets upon
her.’</p>
<p>‘You may see her, if you please,’ said Mr. Hogshead; ‘but it
shall be only in my presence, as, if she is not already past articulation,
you will make her say any thing you please.’</p>
<p>‘In your hearing, if you please; but not in your sight,’ said Mr.
Schwartz; ‘nor must she know that you are near; as that might deter
her from speaking freely; but why should you suppose she has any thing
to say about you?’ said Mr. Schwartz, looking sternly into the villain's
dropping eyes.</p>
<p>‘Well; here is the key,’ said the director, ‘if you will go into my
house they will show you the room she is locked up in.’</p>
<p>On entering the room, Mr. Schwartz found Charlotte lying upon a small
pallet, and apparently in articulo mortis; her features seemed distorted
with the last struggle, and her eyes remained quite closed, till,
approaching close to her head, he said, 
<pb n="178"/>
‘O, my poor girl, how came you in this dreadful condition?’ when,
on recognizing the only tone of sympathy that she ever heard in the
absence of her mistress, a gleam of vivacity for a few minutes lit up her
ruined features.</p>
<p>‘I am murdered, sir,’ she said, ‘by Mr. Hogshead; he passed
the last night with me in this room, and when he found that neither
promise or entreaty could prevail on me to submit to his desires; he
succeeded by the grossest violence in stifling my screams, and effecting
his purpose, and this morning he endeavoured to strangle me, and left
the room, I believe, under the impression that I was dead.’</p>
<p>‘I have already sent for a doctor,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘and I
hope still that you may live; if not, I believe confidently, that you will go to
the Christian's God, Charlotte, who can compensate you even for such
an injury as this; but you must endeavour to forgive the author of it.’</p>
<p>‘O, sir, don't make me live,’ said Charlotte; ‘but don't ask me to
forgive him. Must I say I forgive him, if I feel that I never can.’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘it's useless to say any thing to God
which is not true, as he sees through all disguises, even those by which
we 
<pb n="179"/>
sometimes endeavour to deceive ourselves; pray then for his repentance and
your own forgiveness,’ said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<p>‘O, sir,’ said Charlotte, ‘I cannot think of him and pray. I have
not told you half his cruelty --’</p>
<p>‘What are those lies you are telling against me?’ said Mr.
Hogshead, who had been somewhere within hearing, and presented
himself at that moment at the foot of the bed, in order to overawe her
from disclosing more particulars of his brutality.’</p>
<p>The instant Charlotte saw him, she uttered a piercing shriek, threw her
arms out at him, turned her face violently round into the pillow, fell into
convulsions and expired.</p>
<p>‘I charge you,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘with the ruin and murder of
that helpless girl; and if her countrymen themselves do not avenge her
death, there is One above that will.’</p>
<p>‘Do you mean then,’ said the conscience-struck poltroon, ‘to
invite the negroes to murder me?’</p>
<p>‘Whoso sheddeth man's blood,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘by man
shall his blood be shed.’</p>
<p>Mr. Hogshead muttered something about the end of the d--d humbug
of Christianity being that they should all get their throats cut, and 
<pb n="180"/>
‘that it would serve such fellows as you no more than right, if you were
all flogged out of the colony; and I will do it off this plantation if you
repeat such an accusation against me.’</p>
<p>‘You dare not,’ said Mr. Schwartz, coolly; which was the real fact,
for the negroes loved him and would not have obeyed any direction to ill-treat him, or he would probably have been murdered himself long ago.
But he happened to be a stronger man than the director, who, therefore,
could only have got rid of him by the help of the slaves.</p>
<p>On leaving Mr. Hogshead's house, Mr. Schwartz went immediately and
laid an information against him, both before the officer commanding the
detachment at the outpost, and the police magistrate of the district,
called the Heimrovad, and earnestly requested the immediate arrest of
Mr. Hogshead, if it were only to appease the irritation and prevent the
resentment of the negroes; but they both declined interfering, till they
had an opportunity of communicating with Mr. Cotton.</p>

impunity of the director in his conduct towards poor Charlotte, and his
interruption of their instruction by Mr. Schwartz.</p>
<pb n="182"/>
<p>‘Will you join us,’ said they to Outalissi, ‘in exacting justice?
We are threatened by one with God's eternal vengeance, if we do not
reverence His Son, and we are refused the means of doing so by the
other; every obstacle is interposed to our marrying, and the rite of
baptism is generally denied to our children; we are taunted, sneered at,
spited, cursed; ourselves subjected to murder, and our wives and
daughters to worse than murder - to satiate the lusts of every brutal
manager whom they choose to appoint over us; and they take effectual
care to make redress impossible, let them pass what other laws they will
to deceive the people in their own countries, by that which rejects slave
evidence against themselves; and if, by some extraordinary coincidence
of testimony, any outrage, or even murder, by a white man, is detected,
they are sure either to let him off upon some pretence or other, or, if
convicted, to commute his punishment, in kind, for a fine of a few
thousand guilders in money. We are resolved, therefore, to make them
acknowledge our claim, to be treated as fellow-creatures, and to begin
by inflicting summary justice on this murderer here.’</p>
<p>‘If you will do entirely as I bid you,’ said Outalissi, ‘I will engage,
at all events, to lead you to glorious vengeance before death, although, 
<pb n="183"/>
by want of energy in our efforts, or a thousand accidents, we may be ultimately
disappointed of success; but surely death itself, even without vengeance, is
preferable to such a life as this. Shall I command you?’</p>
<p>‘We earnestly wish to avoid shedding the white men's blood,’ said
they, ‘perhaps, if we are unanimous and peremptory, they may think it
prudent to listen to our just complaints, without driving us to
desperation.’</p>
<p>‘Then be content that the white men should shed yours,’ said
Outalissi; ‘revolutions cannot be made with rose-water, by black men
any more than white.’</p>
<p>‘But all unnecessary bloodshed is contrary to the religion Mr.
  Schwartz has taught to us,’ said they. ‘We cannot give life,<note n="*" place="foot"> See Trial of Missionary Smith. Evidence of Rev. Mr. Austin. -
    <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</note>
and therefore will not take it, except in avenging or repelling murder.’</p>
<p>‘Unnecessary bloodshed!’ exclaimed Outalissi. ‘I abhor the
man who wantonly would set his foot upon a worm, and am not capable
of the cruelty of these lamb-skinned wolves - these Christians, who have
wallowed in the blood of Africa for centuries; and their only necessity
was avarice - 
<pb n="184"/>
ours freedom and revenge for wrongs, compared with which the whole mass of
crime and outrage committed by man against man in the <hi rend="i">unchristian</hi> world
sinks into nothing.’</p>
<p>‘But Mr. Schwartz says, that the authors of these wrongs were <hi rend="i">not</hi>
Christians, but merely pretenders to the name,’ replied his black
disciples.</p>
<p>‘Well, be it so,’ said Outalissi. ‘If Christianity teaches you that it
is not your duty to the dignity of your own rational nature, to your
children, your country, and your God to wipe off from your colour the foul
brand which your infamous cowardice has too long affixed to it, of being
created only for use or abuse by the whites, to be chained and tasked,
and have your sweat exacted</p>

<lg type="poem">
<l>“With stripes, that mercy with a bleeding heart</l>
<l>Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast;”</l>
</lg>

<p>Christianity is falser than the sand of the desert, when it assumes to the
parched lip and burning sight the semblance of water.’</p>
<p>‘Well, lead and we will follow,’ cried the animated slaves.</p>
<p>‘Swear then,’ said Outalissi.</p>
<p>‘So help us God,’ they all exclaimed together, throwing up their
right hands and eyes to Heaven.</p>
<p>‘Then, by my father's blood,’ said Outalissi ‘I will succeed or
die with you.’</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>From this moment Outalissi calmly resigned himself to death, he saw that the
resolution of the Christian slaves was much too equivocal to justify any
reasonable confidence, but he determined to expend such a purchase as he had
upon them in making the utmost atonement in his power to the spirits of his
ancestors, for the indignities under which he had already too long borne to live.</p>
<p>Outalissi soon arranged his plans with great sagacity; but in order to
secure the simultaneous movement of the different bodies of insurgents,
a good deal of previous instruction and communication with them was
indispensable, which would most probably have awakened suspicion
from the frequency of his absence, if the ferocity of the director had not
very opportunely given another cause for it.</p>
<p>They have in Surinam a barbarous punishment, called the Spanso
boeko, or Spanish buck, to which, whenever an owner, administrator, or
director wishes to subject any of his slaves, he has nothing to do but to
send them to the fortress at Paramaribo, with a short note to the public
executioner, who is obliged, for a trifling fee, without any judicial inquiry
whatever to inflict it.</p>
<p>I will describe the punishment to the reader, 
<pb n="186"/>
which is exceedingly severe, and when I tell him, that this punishment is
constantly executed upon <hi rend="i">women</hi> in Surinam, even to this day, he will, I think,
agree with me, that the moral ingredients of the Dutch character, in the West
Indies, whatever they may be elsewhere, form by no means an exception to the
uniformly debasing influence of slavery upon the moral sensibility and dignity
of all who have the misfortune to come for any time within its contaminating
contact.</p>
<p>This is the punishment: - The prisoner's wrists being lashed together,
he is laid down on the ground, on one side, with his knees thrust
sufficiently forward, through his arms, as to drive a perpendicular stake
into the ground behind them, to confine them within the arms, in such a
way that he can scarcely move, any more than if he were dead. In this
locked position, trussed like a fowl, he is beaten on one side of his
breech by a strong negro, with a handful of knotty tamarind branches, till
the very flesh is cut away; he is then turned over on the other side,
where the same dreadful flagellation is inflicted, till not a bit of skin is
left, and the place of execution is dyed with blood. After which the raw
lacerated wound is immediately washed with lemon-juice and gun-
<pb n="187"/>
powder (the pain of which must be inconceivable), to prevent
mortification, and then he is sent home to recover as well as he
  can.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a010">See Note K.</xref></note></p>
<p>Outalissi had been sent by Mr. Hogshead, with several more of Mr.
Cotton's slaves to undergo this punishment. Edward Bentinck, from
curiosity, was accidentally present that morning at the disgusting
spectacle.</p>
<p>‘I am sorry to see you here, Outalissi, for such a purpose,’ said
Edward Bentinck.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Outalissi, ‘do you think I will undergo that
punishment?’</p>
<p>‘Why, what can you do?’ said Edward, ‘resistance will only
increase its severity.’</p>
<p>‘The severity, sir,’ said Outalissi, ‘is a matter to me almost of
indifference. No bodily pain should give these white demons the triumph
of extracting a single groan from the soul of Outalissi; but it is the
brutality and degradation of it that I resent so, and I will never suffer it
alive. I can at the worst dash my brains out of my head against the wall;
but I have some reasons for wishing to defer that for a few weeks
longer, if it is possible.’</p>
<p>Outalissi had, in the mean time, by an imperceptible movement of his
powerful arms, been rubbing or rather cutting in two the cords by 
<pb n="188"/>
which his wrists were bound, against the sharp edge of some pallisades, upon
which he seemed only to be resting them, and when they called upon him to put
himself into the customary position, he overthrew half a dozen of them, dashed
through the rest; wrenched, in half a second, by a sudden twist with both his
hands, the musket and bayonet from the sentry at the gate of the fortress,
plunged into the river, which laves its walls, and in spite of sharks and
alligators, of which it is always full, safely reached the opposite bank with his
prize.</p>
<p>The fiscal put himself, and scouts, and soldiers into a great deal of
perspiration in the pursuit of him, which he might as well have spared,
as he would have had much more chance of retaking a lion, because
here was actually a lion's strength, with a man's intelligence. They saw
no more of him, till they saw him exulting in a vengeance worthy of a
king.</p>
<p>Outalissi's plans were sound, simple, bold, and likely, and he did not
fail to make good use of the facility of constant night-intercourse with his
countrymen, which his escape, from over-sight and controul, gave him,
to complete them. Several slaves, who had been brought up on Mr.
Cotton's plantation happened to be living as domestic ser-
<pb n="189"/>
vants in some of the houses at the windward extremity of Paramaribo. In
that latitude the wind is so uniform, that if there is any, you may almost
certainly depend upon its direction; by the help of those servants, who
were easily prevailed on to join the conspiracy, it was arranged that a
great quantity of strong combustible matter should be gradually collected
and secreted in different parts of these windward houses, and co-instantaneously fired on a signal from Outalissi, who was to command
the operations in town, on Sunday, the twenty-first day of January, one
thousand eight hundred and twenty-one.</p>
<p>Different parties of the confederates (for where is the Englishman, in
the present day, out of the West Indies, after such goading to madness
as has been described, who would be sycophant enough to call them
rebels?) in the country had engaged to fire several of the most outlying
plantations on the preceding Friday, in order to draw the troops too far
from Paramaribo to return in time to interrupt the destruction of the
capital; during the confusion of which, the governor and all the chief
colonial officers were to be seized and secured by Outalissi's party in
town, and compelled to guarantee them freedom of worship and the
equal protection of law with the whites, by the equal ad-
<pb n="190"/>
mission of their testimonial competency; but not a hair of a white man's
head was to be injured, if they would accede to these demands, unless
the soldiers should attempt their rescue; and except where actual
murder had been committed by a white man and remained unpunished,
as at Anne's Grove, where the business was to begin by the just
execution of Mr. Hogshead.</p>
<p>There was at that time no naval force at Paramaribo, so the military
were all that Outalissi had to guard against. The intense anxiety,
therefore, with which he watched their departure from the town, during
Friday and Saturday, may be easily conceived; but when Sunday came,
and the troops remained quiet in the fortress, he saw immediately that
something must have deranged or defeated the concerted movements
of his plantation auxiliaries, and that therefore he must abandon the
chief part of the plan, of which he had undertaken the execution in
Paramaribo; but still he did not see why he should forego that (and
indeed the vengeance was pretty ample) which yet remained in his
power. He, therefore, told his friends, who were awaiting his signal in
small parties about the town, that with such a force to contend with, all
thoughts of personal struggle must for the present be laid aside; that the
wanton waste of either 
<pb n="191"/>
their blood, or that of the white soldiers (who with the least guilt would be the
greatest sufferers) was a thought at which his <hi rend="i">unchristian</hi> heart had ever
sickened; that they must, therefore, confine their present proceeding to the
destruction of property alone, by firing the trains which they had prepared, upon
the signal which he would presently give them; after which they must take care
of themselves, - that as he could not swim across the sea, it was probable he
should not himself long escape apprehension; but he assured them that no racks
or torture should extract from him the name of a single individual that had taken
part with him in this partly abortive conspiracy.</p>
<p>‘Now then,’ said he, ‘to your posts, and farewell! If we meet no
more in this world, we shall in that, where no fiends torment - no
Christians thirst for gold!’</p>
<p>After giving time to the matchmen to return to their several trains, and
the others to disperse and consult their own security in the best way
they could, Outalissi gave the signal agreed upon, and at two o'clock
P.M. on Sunday, the twenty-first of January, one thousand eight hundred
and twenty-one, the house at the extreme windward corner of
  Paramaribo was in a blaze - nobody knew how!</p></div><div type="chapter">

</lg>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> fortress where Mr. Cotton was confined is to the extreme windward
of the town, and altogether detached from it by a small intervening plain,
so that he was quite safe from the fire; but his house, where Matilda
resided, was about the centre of the town, and of course exposed to its
greatest fury. I should have told my readers that Paramaribo, like most
of the towns in the West Indies, is built entirely of wood, and contains
perhaps about ten thousand inhabitants. Matilda's intention was, if the
fire approached at all near, to join her father in the prison, and wait there
till it was extinguished; but so unexampled was the rapidity of its
progress, that when, after making the best arrangements she could for
the preservation of papers and furni-
<pb n="193"/>
ture, she attempted to put her intention into execution, she found the
interposing houses nothing but a solid mass of fire, completely
interrupting in fact all access from the leeward to the windward side of
the town. Many families fled wild and distracted into the leeward
savannahs; but this afforded little security, as there was not a drop of
rain, and if the wind had risen at all, the flames must soon have
overtaken them, or in case of rain they would have perished perhaps still
more miserably from sleeping out of shelter on the swampy ground; and
such was the disgraceful panic and confusion that prevailed, that the
streets (for a lady at least) were almost equally dangerous. Matilda
Cotton therefore calmly resigned herself to Providence, and continued in
the house. The troops employed themselves principally in staving in the
casks, and knocking off the necks of the wine bottles, and before the
end of the day were in consequence so drunk, and so much increased
the confusion, that could Outalissi have re-collected his party, he might
easily have overpowered them.</p>
<p>Edward Bentinck was of course upon duty, and by dint of taunts and
threats, but not without great difficulty, he kept his men in tolerable
order. Three or four of them, who wore the Waterloo medal, but seemed
strongly disposed to tarnish it by 
<pb n="194"/>
following the example of their undisciplined comrades, he fortunately
restrained by asking if they were not ashamed, with such a noble badge of true
military glory upon them, to turn mere marauders, and that against their own
friends and countrymen in the extremity of their distress, for whose protection
they were sent out there - like the ruffians on some parts of the coast of
England, who were charged with being constantly on the look out for
shipwrecks, not to save the unhappy and defenceless sufferers, but to murder
and plunder them, and if an opportunity occurred, decoying any ships in
distress, without distinction of country, to their destruction for that very
purpose? With these three or four steady men Edward Bentinck found it
practicable to controul the rest of the party.</p>
<p>He had procured a station as near as he could to Mr. Cotton's house,
which in less than three hours from the commencement of the fire, was,
with all the adjoining ones, enveloped in flames. Matilda had retired to
an upper room, and was calmly anticipating her fate, (her domestics
having fled in all directions by her express commands,) when Edward
presented himself with half a dozen files of men before her windows.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Bentinck,’ said Matilda, ‘do not, I entreat you, waste your
assistance here, the lower 
<pb n="195"/>
part of the house has been burning some time, and the staircase is already
smoking, so that to attempt its ascent must be suffocation, and it is impossible
that you should reach me alive.’</p>
<p>There was no reply to be made; bursting the doors with the butt ends of
his men's muskets, and leaving them at the bottom of the staircase, in
half a minute Edward was at her side, followed by the flames which burst
from every part of the staircase almost before he entered the room;
retreat therefore by the same road was now really impossible, and the
whole house was in danger of falling in from moment to moment.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Bentinck,’ said Matilda, ‘I must thank you, but you have
acted very wrong; my life was of no value comparatively, yours of much
and immediate importance; we must now both perish in the same
grave.’</p>
<p>‘A grave,’ said Edward, ‘equally worthy of a soldier and a
devoted friend, Miss Cotton! since you deny me a still better claim to it;
but I am confident we may still avoid it, if you will trust yourself for two
minutes in my arms, if not, I promise you that I will share your fate.’</p>
<p>If Matilda had not been habitually superior to all affectation, in such
circumstances she felt that she had no right to relinquish any reasonable
<pb n="196"/>
chance of saving her own life, much less if by so hesitating she should involve
that of another.</p>
<p>‘But I see,’ said she, ‘no possible way in which your arms can
avail me, or certainly I would gladly embrace it.’</p>
<p>‘Put yourself into this sling,’ said Edward, tying the two ends of
his sash together, ‘and if you will make a seat of one end of it, I will
put the other round my neck; and then, if you will also put one of your
arms round and hold firmly, I have no doubt that mine are sufficiently
strong, by the help of the lamp irons and a rope made of two or three of
your shawls, to convey you safe from the windows to the street,’
which accordingly in that way without much difficulty he effected.</p>
<p>But when Edward Bentinck, with his lovely burden, had reached the
street, he was almost as much at a loss how to dispose of her as ever;
for if the fire had been produced by incendiaries it would probably be
followed by an insurrection of the slaves, and it was impossible to tell
what outrages might accompany it. At length he prevailed on her to allow
him to carry her on board the William the First, a ship of five hundred
tons burthen lying in the harbour, in which he had come from Holland,
and the captain of which was a man of great respectability; with whom,
therefore, having 
<pb n="197"/>
as he thought left her in temporary safety, he returned to his duties in the town.</p>
<p>The conflagration continued to rage with ungovernable fury, so that, in
fact, in the space of less than eight hours from the commencement, the
core of the town was burnt to a stump, and the houses in the skirts and
suburbs continued blazing all night. At eight o'clock the dome of the
beautiful octagon brick church, which was covered with shingles, a sort
of wooden tiles, and stood in the very centre of the town, burst into a
flame, and threw up one unbroken circular column of blaze of eighty feet
diameter. At twelve o'clock at midnight a report, which sounded like the
discharge of a piece of ordnance from one of the ships, attracted all
eyes to the harbour, where they saw the flames playing about the
shrouds and rigging of the William the First, which had caught fire from
the intense heat and constant shower of blazing spars and burning
ashes from the town, some of which had fallen into the hold, and in ten
minutes her whole deck from stem to stern burst into a flame, and her
cabin looked through her stern windows like the furnace of a glass-house, or that which was prepared by Nebuchadnezzar for Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego. The Betsy, a large ship of three hundred tons,
lying close to her, next caught fire, 
<pb n="198"/>
and both were burned to the water's edge. Not a hand could be spared from the
other vessels, the captains of which were now only intent on saving themselves
and cargoes by cutting their cables, and warping, drifting, or towing out of
danger; and a second time the life of poor Matilda was suspended on a hair. The
captain and several of his sailors had been blown up at the time of what was
thought to be the discharge of a piece of ordnance, but which, in fact, was an
explosion of a case of gunpowder in the hold, whilst they were pouring water
down the gangway. Matilda, at the moment of this explosion, was in the cabin,
to which the flames had not yet extended; and the surviving seamen, either
forgetting Matilda in the cabin, or concluding that she must have shared the fate
of the captain and their messmates, sprang from the forecastle, and were
disposed of between the sharks and the other ships, which one or two of them
only reached in safety, the ropes of the ships' boats had soon been burnt
asunder, and the boats gone adrift. In this extremity Matilda was seen for a few
seconds in an imploring attitude in the mizen chains, till her clothes caught fire,
and then she plunged into the water, the ship having by this time been carried
out by the tide a considerable distance from the shore.</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>The agony of Edward Bentinck, when he saw the William the First in flames,
and reproached himself that by the persuasion he had used to prevail on Miss
Cotton to take refuge there, he had been the author of her present danger, was
greater probably than even that of Matilda herself. After waiting many seconds
in a vain attempt to launch a canoe through a bank of mud, on which it had been
left by the ebb tide, he was upon the point of plunging from the quay to swim
towards the vessel; but would never probably have reached it, much less
succeeded in returning with Matilda in the same manner, who must therefore
have perished if a quicker eye and stronger arm than Edward's, and a heart at
least equally bold and faithful had not interposed to rescue her a second time
from her impending fate.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Outalissi, who had watched and knew every thing, and
rushed to the harbour when he saw the flames had reached the
shipping, seizing Edward by the shoulder, and holding him back at the
instant he was about to spring into the water, ‘If <hi rend="i">I</hi> cannot save the
lady, I am sure <hi rend="i">you</hi> cannot; and if you should accompany me and sink in
the effort, you will only embarrass and may entangle us both. If I was
encumbered with your ridiculous and suffocating dress, I could not
possibly 
<pb n="200"/>
succeed myself; but lend me your sword,’ said he, at the same time
gently snatching it out of Edward's hand, and springing like a flying fish
nearly twenty feet from the quay, he reached the mizen chains of the
William the Third, just in time to receive Matilda in his left arm as she
threw herself into the water; and propelling himself principally by his feet,
and making violent sweeps through the water with Edward's sword in his
right-hand, the bright blade of which, by reflection from the blazing ship,
made a stream of light about them which probably scared away all the
<hi rend="i">water-christians</hi>, (as Outalissi used to call the sharks and alligators,) he
brought her safe on shore, where he was received with a loud shout of
acclamation; and returning his sword to Edward Bentinck, he committed
Matilda to his charge.</p>
<p>‘Outalissi,’ said Matilda, ‘you have nobly won your freedom,
and I will not rest till I have procured it for you.’</p>
<p>‘At present I <hi rend="i">am</hi> free,’ said Outalissi. ‘Mr. Bentinck can explain
to you how I became so; and,’ said he, kneeling on one knee, and
respectfully just touching the hand which Matilda offered him with his
lips, ‘I have one boon only to request of my sweet and good young
mistress, that when she hears my unhappy race cried down below
<pb n="201"/>
the beasts of blood and burden, she will say that she knew at least one
African, whose gratitude extended to the cheerful risk of his life;’ and
before Matilda could reply, he had disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Where shall I have the honour of conducting Miss Cotton,’ said
Edward Bentinck, ‘as I am sorry to say not a vestige remains of her
house; and excepting a few trunks and boxes which we contrived to drag
out of the hall, and which I have already sent up to Mr. Cotton, not a
fragment remains of any furniture!’</p>
<p>‘O, my father! my father!’ said Matilda, ‘since the intervening
town is now reduced to a plain of ashes, the gaoler's wife or daughter
will supply me with a change of clothes for the present, and my father
will be deranged if he has heard of my danger till he is assured of my
escape, and I am sure he will find an opportunity of thanking both my
kind friends, (for I must never overlook the service of Outalissi,) as they
deserve for their generous self-devotion.’</p>
<p>‘I cannot stay now,’ said Edward Bentinck, ‘to receive Mr.
Cotton's thanks,’ as he parted from Matilda at the door of the prison,
‘but I shall be overpaid if my exertions on this occasion should restore
me to the rank which I once flattered myself that I enjoyed in the good
opinion of Miss Cotton.’</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>On Matilda's entering her father's apartment he started up, clasped his hands,
and folding her to his heart, exclaimed, ‘Now let them take all, since my
darling child's preserved to me. How thankful we should be that your
brother Charles is still at Anne's Grove. But to whom am I indebted for
this great mercy?’</p>
<p>When Matilda had described the occurrences in which she was either
party or spectator, ‘I have wronged them both then,’ said Mr.
Cotton; ‘I have wronged them grievously, but I trust I may yet live to
repair to both the injustice I have done them.’ In fact, Mr. Cotton was
exceedingly ill; totally unaccustomed to confinement, its effects only for
a few weeks, (added to his apprehension of the probability of greater
punishment,) in a miserable close dungeon, had become very evident in
his strength, spirits, and appearance, and his agony for the few hours he
was in suspense about his daughter, and perhaps the no less agitating
surprise of his joy on his ocular conviction of her safety, threw him into a
considerable fever, in which I must leave Matilda to attend him for the
present, while I pursue the other parts of my story.</p>
<p>On the morning after the fire, the place where Paramaribo <hi rend="i">had been</hi>,
resembled only the plain of 
<pb n="203"/>
  Sodom and Gomorrah; nothing remained within the range of the fire but the
brick, stumps, and foundations of the houses and smoking ashes, except two or
three houses occupied by British residents, who not giving way to the general
panic, by great exertions kept off the flames successfully through the awful
  night.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a011">See Note L.</xref></note> The amount of property destroyed was computed at twelve
hundred thousand pounds; and Outalissi could not help leaning against one of
the unprostrated columns of the central octagon church for half an hour after
sunrise, surveying with great complacency, or rather exultation, the sublime
spectacle of desolation of which he was the author, ‘O!’ said he to
himself, ‘that those accursed Christians that fired my peaceful village,
and with the remorselessness of fiends consigned me and all my tribe to
a life of hopeless exile and anguish, and the slow but sure extermination
  of the coarse, cold, cowardly, material, heartless, hopeless, inexorable<note n="†" place="foot"><xref to="a012">See Note M.</xref></note>
cruelties of Dutch bondage, could witness this scene!! Although the
destruction of ten times the property scarcely deserves the name of
vengeance for the enslavement of a single mind, or the wanton
extinction of a single life, yet, when they see what 
<pb n="204"/>
one bold heart and able hand can do, let them tremble for the certain day of full

<p>‘O! had there but been two Outalissis, even now the glorious prize of
freedom would have here been won; but these Christian cowards at
Anne's Grove, as I foreboded, have defeated the best half of my design;
either their own hearts have failed them, or they have been betrayed by
their sly prophet Mr. Schwartz.’ There was an expression of defiance
in the noble figure and attitude of Outalissi during this soliloquy which did
not escape the observation of the passengers, and upon an intimation of
their suspicions to the town-guard, he was dodged, and from falling into
one of the undisclosed cellars amongst the ruins, was ultimately 
<pb n="205"/>
taken and lodged in another part of the same prison with his soi-disant owner.</p>
<p>I must now return with my readers to the conspirators at Anne's Grove.
On the Friday preceding the destruction of the colonial capital, they
commenced operations by seizing Mr. Hogshead, with the intention of
immediately executing him for his cruelty to Charlotte Venture; after
which they were, according to their arrangements with Outalissi, to make
a blaze of the buildings, and then proceed directly before there should be
time for the soldiers to intercept them, to assist their confederates in
confining the whites, and firing the buildings upon all the neighbouring
plantations. They recognized willingly the super cession of the <hi rend="i">Lex
Talionis</hi> by the Christian religion, and instead of slowly flogging Mr.
Hogshead to death, or employing any torture, they were merely
proceeding to put a pistol to his brain, when Mr. Schwartz (who knew
nothing positively of their intentions but from the general murmurs of
dissatisfaction with which Mr. Hogshead, who was the cause of them,
could not but be aware, as well as himself,) being now anxiously upon
the watch, presented himself to them, and declared, that if they took Mr.
Hogshead's life or any other, or had recourse to a single act of violence
till they knew 
<pb n="206"/>
whether redress in the particular case of Charlotte Venture, and adequate
protection against the recurrence of such outrages or any other gross injustice,
could be obtained by a firm and general demand of it from the government, he
would strike their names out of his list of Christ's disciples in that colony. After
a long debate, the negroes were prevailed on to be content with putting the
director into the stocks; but hesitation and vacillation in all these cases is almost
always fatal. Before they had effected this design, (after losing so much time in
discussion with Mr. Schwartz,) a detachment of soldiers had been brought up by
one of the pampered and favourite drivers of the director, who had run down
unobserved at the commencement of the tumult to the outpost, where Edward
Bentinck had been stationed some weeks before, but which was new occupied
by the officer who had relieved him.</p>
<p>On the arrival of the soldiers, all the ulterior parts of Outalissi's projects
were at once defeated.</p>
<p>The director was of course rescued and set at liberty; the negroes were
confined upon the plantation under a strong guard, - and upon Mr.
Hogshead declaration to the officer in command, that Mr. Schwartz had
been the instigator of the whole business, although this same officer had
refused 
<pb n="207"/>
only a short time before to attend to or interfere with the complaint of Mr.
Schwartz against Mr. Hogshead for rape and murder, Mr. Schwartz, after having
had all his papers, even his private journal, seized and taken from him, was sent
off on Sunday as soon as their apprehension of further explosion had subsided a
little, under a military escort, with a letter from Mr. Hogshead to the fiscal, and
another from the ensign on the spot to his commanding officer to Paramaribo,
where he arrived with the tide on Monday evening, and was immediately
consigned to a share of Outalissi's dungeon. At the same time, Mr. Hogshead,
who knew nothing of what had happened at Paramaribo, took the opportunity
for the sake of his security of sending up little Charles Cotton to his father, who
with some difficulty procured, as a temporary asylum for him and his sister, and
her dispersed domestics, one of the houses in a place called the Combay, a sort
of suburb to Paramaribo, but to the windward of the fortress, and a little lower
  down the river.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<p><hi rend="sc">On</hi> the morning following the fire, from some suspicions which attended
its origin, and a rumour which reached the government, of the
disturbance at Anne's Grove, martial law was proclaimed, and in a day or
two following upon the accusation of Mr. Hogshead a court-martial was
assembled for the trial of Mr. Schwartz and Outalissi, for ‘exciting and
provoking the negro slaves within the colony to open revolt and rebellion
against the authority of their lawful masters, managers, and overseers,
and aiding and assisting in such revolt and rebellion, contrary to their
allegiance, and 
<pb n="209"/>
against the peace of their Sovereign Lord the King his crown and dignity.’ I
shall not trouble my reader with the mockery of forms employed on this
occasion. Absolute power was never known to be baffled in its purposes
for want of form, and this opportunity of indulging the infidelity and
antipathy which prevailed in the colony against Christianity, in the person
of one of its ministers, was not to be lost. I shall only say, that in order to
give an impression of legality to their proceedings they made the chief
justice of the colony, one Mr. Van Yaruu, a very worthy man, as I have
been informed, a colonel of the militia-staff, and most unaccountably
prevailed on him to be president, or senior member of the court.</p>
<p>After the arraignment was gone through, the first evidence adduced
was the private journal of Mr. Schwartz, from which were read the
following select extracts.</p>
<p>‘July 6, 1817. - While at dinner at half past three o'clock Lucinda
came in with a sorrowful countenance. Lucinda is a member of the
church, and much affected with the Gospel. She is an old woman, and
though her manager tells her not to come to church, she tells him she
<hi rend="i">will</hi> come, even if he cuts her throat for it.’</p>
<p>‘August 30, 1817. - The negroes have com-
<pb n="210"/>
plained to me lately of excessive labour, and very severe treatment. I told one of
their overseers that I thought they would work the people to death.’</p>
<p>‘September 13, 1817. - This evening a negro belonging to Mr. Kuster
came to me, saying, the manager was so cruel to him he could not bear
it. According to the man's account, some time back, two or three years,
he with a few others made a complaint of the same thing to the fiscal, on
which account the manager has taken a great dislike to him, and
scarcely ever meets him without cursing him as he passes by. The
punishment which he inflicts upon him is dreadfully severe; for every little
thing he flogs him. I believe Ned to be a quiet harmless man. I think he
does his work very well. A manager told me himself that he had <hi rend="i">punished
many negroes merely to spite Mr. Wilberforce</hi>. I believe the laws of
justice which relate to the negroes are only known by name here, for
while I am writing this the driver is flogging the people, neither manager
nor overseer near.’</p>
<p>‘March --. - While writing this my very heart <hi rend="i">flutters</hi> at hearing the
almost incessant cracking of the whip. Having just finished reading Mr.
Walker's Letters on the West Indies, I have thought 
<pb n="211"/>
much of the treatment of the negroes, and likewise of the state of their minds. It
appears to me very probable that ere long they will resent the injuries done to
them. I should think it my duty to state my opinion respecting this to some of the
rulers of the colony, but am fearful from the conduct of the fiscal, in this late
affair of the negroes being worked on Sundays, that they would be more
solicitous to silence me, by requiring me to criminate some individual, than to
redress the wrongs done to the slaves, by diligently watching the conduct of the
planters themselves, and bringing them to justice (without the intervention of
missionaries) when they detect such abuses of the law as frequently take
place.’</p>
<p>‘November 17. - Yesterday evening we had not more than fifty at
chapel; indeed I cannot expect many more till the coffee and cotton are
gathered in. The people have scarcely any time to eat their food - they
have none to cook it, eating for the most part raw yellow plantains. This
would be bearable for a time, but to work at that rate, and to be
perpetually flogged, astonishes me that they will submit to it.’</p>
<p>‘November --. - Jackey of Dochfour, and Peter of the Hope, came
into the house evidently much depressed in mind, to relate what they
con-
<pb n="212"/>
ceived an unexampled case of persecution, it was in brief, that their respective
managers, under a show of friendly familiarity, accosted the Christian negroes
with taunting jokes, on the subject of religion, in presence of the heathen
negroes, representing that their profession was only hypocrisy, and that a trifling
consideration would prevail with them to abandon it, for which they ought to be
treated with scorn and contempt. By diabolism some of these poor negroes had
been provoked to adopt language in a manner said to be disrespectful, and for
this insolence they had been repeatedly flogged and confined in the stocks. The
complainants wanted to know what they were to do in such a case. I advised
them accordingly.’</p>
<p>‘May --. - Whilst at breakfast this morning I received a
communication from the Burgher Captain, the substance of which is, to
persuade the planters not to allow the slaves to attend chapel on
Sunday, without a pass, and in an indirect manner, not to allow them to
come at all in the evening, and even on a Sunday to send an overseer
with the slaves, as judges of the doctrines we preach. The circular
appears to me designed to throw an impediment in the way of the slaves
receiving instruction, under colour of a desire to meet the wishes of his
majesty's government.’</p>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>‘June --. - Isaac of Triumph came in to ask whether the Governor's
new law, as he called it, forbid the slaves meeting together on the
estates to which they belonged, in an evening, for the purpose of
learning the catechism. Their manager, he said, had threatened to
punish them if they held any meeting. I informed him that the law gave
the manager no such power, and that it had nothing to do with that
subject.’</p>
<p>‘July --. - Mr. Elliott, another missionary, has just left our house: he
came merely to see us. I was glad to hear he had at length commenced
evening preaching once a week on the coast, on a Thursday evening. It
appears the same impediments are thrown in the way of instructing the
negroes on the west coast as on the east, and it will be so as long as the
present system prevails, or rather exists.’</p>
<p>‘July --. - Mrs. de Florimant and her two daughters called to take
leave of us: they are going to Holland. Hogshead the manager came with
them. His conversation immediately turned upon the new regulations
expected in the British West Indies. He declared that if he was prevented
flogging the women, he would keep them in solitary confinement without
food, it they were not punctual with their work. He, however, com-
<pb n="214"/>
forted himself in the belief that such a project could never be carried into effect
in this colony, and in this I certainly agree with him. The rigours of negro
slavery, I am afraid, can never be mitigated - the system must be abolished.’</p>
<p>Extracts of this sort might be multiplied <hi rend="i">ad infinitum</hi> from the journal of
  every honest man in Surinam who keeps a journal.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a013">See note N.</xref></note> I will not
therefore weary my readers with any more, but only say, that by
constructive ingenuity in the use of private papers, although containing
merely the plainest truths in the simplest language, by the admission of
hearsay evidence, and the intimidation of the gospel-shaken courage of
some Christian negroes to bear false witness, the charges comprised in
Mr. Schwartz's arraignment were quite proved to the satisfaction of the
Court, and he was ordered to proceed with his defence.</p>
<p>Dressed in his usual simple, unaffected manner, with an expression of
stern composure, but not the slightest appearance of passion or defiance
in his countenance, Mr. Schwartz, as if he was speaking from some
internal prompting, without the power of deviation, shortly addressed the
Court as follows:</p>
<p>‘Mr. President Van Yaruu, and Gentlemen of the Court. In the first
place I protest against 
<pb n="215"/>
the jurisdiction of a military court to try a civil subject for any language or
action expressed or committed <hi rend="i">before</hi> the proclamation of martial law, which if
it could give retrospective authority to such proceedings for a single day, might
do so equally for the whole period of a man's life. I protest also against the
admission of hearsay evidence, and much more against the admission of such
evidence when in favour of the prosecution, and its rejection when in favour of
my exculpation; and, lastly, against any charges derived from the prosecutor's
discretional construction of my private papers. Having thus from a sense of duty
to my wife and children, and after St. Paul's example in appealing to Cæsar,
stated these preliminary objections, in order to avail myself of such protection as
the laws of my country may afford me, which is the birthright of every subject; I
disclaim in so doing the slightest intentional disrespect to the Court, being
entirely without personal feeling on the subject, firmly believing that they can
have no power over me except it be given them from above; and that if it should
please my divine master, who has done me the great honour to employ my life in
his service, here to terminate my feeble but cheerful and earnest endeavour to
walk worthy of so 
<pb n="216"/>
high a vocation, he will overrule my death to be of still more service to Him
than my life.</p>
<p>‘I have no other defence than to prove that my instructions to the
negroes upon all occasions have been in strict conformity to the
doctrines and directions of the religion which I am appointed to teach.
That by showing the contrast of the lives and conversations of the whites
with the laws and institutions of Christ, those instructions may have had
the effect of lowering the whites in the estimation of their slaves, I dare
not for a moment deny; for if Balak would give me his house full of silver
and gold I would not even to save my life utter a falsehood, or go beyond
what I believed to be the word and will of God. If, for example, I preached
to the negroes the observance of the sabbath, and that God is no
respecter of persons, and the whites treat its observance with derision,
the negroes <hi rend="i">must</hi> conclude either that I am imposing upon them for a
divine commandment what is not a law of God, or that the whites are bad
men, or at least in that particular, objects of the Almighty's displeasure.
The same argument will apply to every precept in the Decalogue, and
every principle of Christianity, and there is no way of avoiding the
possibility of such a consequence from instructing your slaves 
<pb n="217"/>
in Christianity, but by a reformation here in Surinam upon Christian principles
of your whole social edifice. The heaviest penalties are denounced by
inspiration against those who preach mutilated gospels. <hi rend="i">I</hi> dare not do it; indeed
it would be vain, because such gospels would be utterly incomprehensible as a
restorative dispensation for the re-impression of the moral image of his Maker
on the fallen soul of man, and I have one of the highest authorities of the Church
of England, viz. that of Bishop Horsley, for saying, that to do any good, and
notwithstanding the liability of some things hard to be understood to be wrested
by the unlearned and unstable to their own destruction, the 'WHOLE Gospel
with all its mysteries <hi rend="i">must</hi> be laid before all congregations.' Unless the whole
edifice of God's Christian temple be reared together in the human heart, the
connexion of its parts with each other cannot be comprehended, or its grace,
symmetry, and loveliness appreciated as they deserve. I shall prove that in my
professional intercourse with your slaves I have never by word or action
exceeded my bounden duty as a Christian minister in endeavouring to lay in
their minds the foundation of this comprehensive building, and having done
that, I confess I shall not be 
<pb n="218"/>
very careful of the issue of this trial, for although for the sake of my family I
sometimes feel a human wish to live, it would ill become the confidence in that
parental providence, in which I have lived and walked up to this day, to doubt
its extension to my orphan children, and their widowed mother, my beloved
companion through this vale of trial, my fellow-labourer indeed I may truly call
her in Christ's vineyard, for but for her heaven-vouchsafed support I might
perhaps myself sometimes have sunk under the burden and heat of the day;
whether, therefore, to myself the issue of this trial be life or death - <hi rend="i">Te Deum
laudamus!</hi>’</p>
<p>When Mr. Schwartz was about to call his witnesses, he was desired by
the Court to withdraw, and upon his return he was informed, that such a
line of defence as he had adopted was quite inadmissible; that they (his
judges) sat there as a court of military and colonial policy, and not of
polemics; and that unless he could prove that his preaching had in no
way either directly or indirectly contributed to the revolt, his proving
merely that he had preached nothing but the doctrines of Christianity
could not avail him.</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz bowed, and said that he had no other defence to offer.</p>
<pb n="219"/>
<p>‘But before you leave the Court, Mr. Schwartz,’ said Mr. Van
Yaruu, ‘I must beg you to answer a few plain questions which I ask,
really that we may know a little what we are about, in the toleration here
of this modern spirit of Evangelism.</p>
<p>We are living upon <hi rend="i">suppositos cineres</hi>, and must suppress the
uncontrouled circulation of any inflammatory matter, be it what it may. If
you thought the introduction of Christianity amongst the negroes would
produce revolution, would you continue to preach?’</p>
<p>‘Most assuredly,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘I would preach it at the
risk of any possible temporal consequences, or I should not deserve the
name of a Christian missionary.’</p>
<p>‘Do you think,’ continued Mr. Van Yaruu, ‘that revolution <hi rend="i">will</hi> be
the consequence?’</p>
<p>‘That,’ replied Mr. Schwartz, ‘depends upon whether his
Netherlands Majesty's government is Christian or Infidel, of which you
are better judges than I am. If there are no channels prepared by
government for the flood of light which must accompany the progress of
Christianity, I think it may.’</p>
<p>‘If you were <hi rend="i">sure</hi> revolution would ensue in this colony from the
introduction of Christianity 
<pb n="220"/>
amongst the slaves, would you still persist in preaching it?’ said Mr. Van
Yaruu.</p>
<p>‘If,’ said the undaunted martyr, ‘the pile of moral enormity, of
which your social edifice is composed, stood like the house of Dagon
upon pillars, and I were sure that preaching Christianity would have the
same effect as that produced by Sampson in removing one of them, I
would continue to preach it, although I buried myself in the ruins of the
system which it overthrew.’</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Colonel Van Yaruu, ‘the negroes in the West Indies
do not feel the degradation of their situation, as you would make the
people in Europe believe?’</p>
<p>‘Then be easy!’ said Mr. Schwartz; ‘they will not have recourse
to violence to escape it.’</p>
<p>‘But you make them feel it,’ observed the president.</p>
<p>‘It is impossible,’ said Mr. Schwartz, ‘to preach Christianity
without. The simple question therefore at last is, whether Revelation be
of God or man; if of the latter, it will come to nought; but if of the former,
ye cannot overthrow it. But upon this question, gentlemen, you must, like
every other man, decide for yourselves. I presume not 
<pb n="221"/>
to enter into it with gentlemen of your education and abundant sources of
information.’</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz was then remanded to his prison (a low, damp, wretched
cell, over a sink of water, with the boards of the floor gaping half an inch
asunder), and told by the Court, that he should be acquainted with the
decision in the course of the evening. The members at the same time
affecting to shudder at the notions he had expressed of the paramount
claims upon his exertions and life of the service of Revelation (which
gave him a pretty clear intimation of what that decision would be), as if,
had the noble martyr felt otherwise, he could have really been a believer
in the divine authority of Revelation, or as if, had he spoken otherwise,
he would not have been a dissembler.</p>
<p>The next person brought before the Court, and the only negro of whom
I shall here give any account, was Outalissi. Nothing could be finer than
the contrast between the carriage of the Christian martyr and the patriot
of nature. REVENGE was considered by the former as a species of
sacrilege, a daring and impious innovation of the expressly served
prerogative of God; indeed, from habitual reference, in all his conduct, to
the indisputable direction of some unerring authority, he seemed 
<pb n="222"/>
incapable of admitting resentment or any egotistical feelings into his
motives; he was perfectly self-possessed and composed, but his serenity
seemed derived, like that of Elisha and his servant, from the rampart of
horses and chariots of fire, with which the eye of faith disclosed to him
that he was girdled, and not from the consciousness of any resources
within himself; persecution aimed at him seemed to recoil upon itself, not
from reverberation against his fortitude, but from his inobviousness to the
blow, like striking at a ghost. His animal body was certainly present, and
appeared tangible, but his most intimate sensibilities seemed to be
disblended from it, and merely to sit over it in discipline and regulation of
conduct.</p>
<q rend="bq">‘Though round his breast the rolling clouds were spread,<lb/>
Eternal sunshine (seemed already to have) settled on his head.’</q>

<p>Very different was the air of the noble representative of original man, as
he approached the bar of the Court; revenge was to him not only a
legitimate human passion, but an imperative duty, an exercise of piety,
and there was a sullen smile of exultation upon his face at the success
which had attended his pursuit of it. Pride in his port, defiance in his eye,
he looked as if aristocracy was 
<pb n="223"/>
an institution of nature, and he was a peer of the first rank.</p>
<p>No animal that I ever saw approaches man in beauty of conformation, where
the symmetry evidently intended by nature is perfectly developed. Where this is
the case in Europe, it is not distinguishable through the burlesque of the
  European costume, and from some cause or other,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a014">See Note O.</xref></note> it is certainly not
generally (although, perhaps, oftener) seen unimpaired amongst the
unluxuriated children of nature, but in the present case it was so. Nothing could
be more imposing than the appearance of Outalissi, his figure was quite equal to
that of the Apollo Belvidere, and he stood before the Court with as much naked
majesty of person, but more human impetuosity of character in his face; the
expression of his countenance indeed was one of perfect self-possession and
composure, as well as that of Mr. Schwartz; but Outalissi's composure arose
evidently not from the absence of passion, but the intenseness of self-controul -
exultation, disdain, and conscious self-sufficiency, and fortitude of nerve to
conceal every emotion of weakness that could give the slightest triumph to his
Christian judges, under any tortures which they might 
<pb n="224"/>
inflict, seemed the ascendant feelings. And when (after his arraignment was read
to him, charging him with being concerned with the other disciples of Mr.
Schwartz in the proceedings at Anne's Grove, and also with the destruction of
Paramaribo, and the evidence, such as it was, gone through), Mr. Van Yaruu,
the president, said, ‘Outalissi, you have heard what has been witnessed
against you; what have you to say in your defence?’</p>
<p>The noble prisoner, without either insolence or abjectness, but in a tone
of great energy, and the simple and impressive eloquence of truth,
expressed himself to the following effect: -</p>
<p>‘A band of Christian sailors, not many moons ago (of one of whom I
had saved the life and nursed and sheltered him in my peaceful cabin,
and who was thus enabled to discover it to his companions,) coming
upon us by surprise at midnight, when we were defenceless and
unarmed, set fire to my much loved village, and in the confusion seized
and bound the unhappy and unoffending inhabitants; I alone escaped
their hands at first, but afterwards became their prey, by a stratagem of
the most cruel perfidy - they bribed me to surrender myself, by a promise
which they have since confessed that they never meant to have fulfilled
of releasing my aged mother, but she 
<pb n="225"/>
would not be persuaded to accept either life or liberty without mine; thanks,
however, to the Great Spirit, she soon obtained the best sort of release, by death;
and the Christian slave traders, after committing every outrage and violence
upon the other women and children, and murdering the sick and disabled,
transported all the wretched survivors, including myself, to irredeemable slavery
in your pestilential swamps here; every inmate of my hearth, even my faithful
dog, having been first destroyed by them, - there runs not a drop of Outalissi's
blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge, and I
have sought, and in some degree, although not adequately, found it; <hi rend="i">I</hi> DID
destroy your town, and I rejoice that I have so far appeased the spirits of my
fathers, and wiped out at least <hi rend="i">some</hi> of the indignities suffered by them from
Christians, in the person of their son. Had I not been disappointed of the support
I had depended on, my vengeance would have been ampler still; as it was, many
lives were in my power, but single victims were not worthy of my deep-stung
indignation. Do not think I spared them from fear, Outalissi never knew fear,
and now would not turn upon his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for
Outalissi? Not one; but I have no <hi rend="i">Christian</hi> thirst for blood, I 
<pb n="226"/>
am not a Christian, and was not induced to any thing which I have done by Mr.
Schwartz, whom I believe (although he has had the misfortune to be born in a
Christian country) to be a good man, and in spite of his Christian prejudices to
be worthy of the care and love of the Great Spirit - the just and common father
of us all.’</p>
<p>Upon this speech, which was uttered with the utmost moderation, i.e.
without any thing like bravado or insolence, although with great energy
and firmness by one of the finest looking negroes that was, perhaps,
ever seen; Mr. Hogshead, who was in Court, breaking through all
decorum, called out - ‘Rascal! that is not what we want to know; we do
not care about your indignities or injuries, or your cursed humbug about
African villages, and peace, and hearths, and dogs, or any thing else that
belonged to you; the only chance you have of saving your life is, to give
us a list of all the others whom you and that d--d white hypocrite, Mr.
Schwartz, prevailed on to be concerned with you in this rebellion; and if
you will not do it without, the torture shall make you confess crimes as
black as yourself, as well as those of your hateful accomplices.’</p>
<p>To which Outalissi, who now swelled in every 
<pb n="227"/>
vein with indignation and contempt, replied, ‘<hi rend="i">Christians</hi>,’ which he
always considered the most opprobrious name by which he could
address any one, ‘the tigers have trembled for these hands,’
holding them up, ‘and dare you think to threaten me with your
wretched instruments; no, I despise the utmost tortures you can now
invent, as much as I do the pitiful wretch who threatens to inflict
  them.<note n="*" place="foot"> See Stedman, vol. ii. pages 209, 210. - <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</note> You shall not extort from me the name of a single person
that was engaged with me; although I now declare to you (because I
know by so doing that I shall drive a dagger through your coward soul)
that they were more in number than their Christian tyrants.’</p>
<p>Mr. Van Yaruu upon this, after very properly reproving Mr. Hogshead for
his indecorum in interrupting the prisoner's defence and violating the
solemnity of the Court, asked Outalissi if he had any thing more to say;
and, upon his declining, remanded him back to the same dungeon with
Mr. Schwartz; where, in the course of the evening, the verdict of guilty,
and sentence of death were communicated to both of them, and they
were ordered to prepare for execution on the following 
<pb n="228"/>
day, before which, however, they were told, that the rack would probably be
employed upon both of them at the place of execution, if they did not in the
  mean time give up the names of <hi rend="i">their accomplices</hi>.</p></div><div type="chapter">

<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> addition to Mr. Schwartz and Outalissi, whom we left at the close of
the last chapter anticipating their martyrdom on the ensuing morning,
there were two other unhappy prisoners under sentence of death; the one
was an Englishman for forgery, the other a Dutch Roman Catholic soldier
for the murder of his sergeant, and as the authorities thought it would
give an air of impartiality to their proceedings that the four should suffer
toge-
<pb n="230"/>
ther, these also were ordered to prepare for execution, which was
appointed to take place on the plain before the government house.</p>
<p>The morning was a particularly fine one, the sun rose with unusual
splendour. The garrison was early under arms, the instruments of torture
were on the ground, and the four men were marched round the plain
behind the military band, playing the dead march, and attended by a
strong guard to the last spot which was to receive their earthly footsteps.
Four graves were dug a little in the rear, with a coffin in front of each, and
in front of the coffins were the rack and other machines for extorting
confessions.</p>
<p>The soldier preceded the other prisoners in the procession, with the
Catholic domine by his side, bare-headed, and with the crucifix in his
hand, which he ever and anon held up before the eyes of his unhappy
disciple, exclaiming with great fervour -</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>O! Crux alma dei sacro medefacta cruore</l>
<l>Offer opem citius brachia pande sibi!</l>
</lg>
<p>And when the man seemed (by a look of agony, for he scarcely spoke a
word) to ask if such mercy could be meant <hi rend="i">for him?</hi> ‘Yes! for you,’
said the domine emphatically, ‘and every truly 
<pb n="231"/>
humbled sinner, if you will only restrain your doubts.’</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>Turn to this symbol your admiring eyes,</l>
<l>Believe! rush forward, and possess the prize!</l>
</lg>
<p>This man had been a desperate character and a murderer, but it was
impossible not to sympathize with the manly propriety of his comportment
on this awful occasion. There was no inebriety, no bravado, but the most
soldierly gaze of defiance upon death, in the certainty of its immediate
incurrence, without a perceptible tremor, as he knelt upon his appointed
coffin.</p>
<p>‘Is it philosophy, or insensibility, or religion, that supports this man
now?’ said Edward Bentinck to Sergeant Vanderdonder, both of whom
were of course upon duty with the rest of the garrison, ‘and if religion,
is it a false peace?’</p>
<p>‘I don't know,’ said the Sergeant, very nobly, for the culprit had
attempted once to murder, and actually stabbed the Sergeant
Vanderdonder out of jealousy, ‘whatever it is, the man is now about to
expiate his crimes against the world with his life, and has not God a right
to forgive those against himself, without asking leave of man's partial
views of comparative justice?’</p>
<p>‘Well said, sergeant,’ said Edward, ‘God forgive him, poor
fellow!’</p>
<pb n="232"/>
<p>‘Amen!’ said the honest sergeant, ‘as I hope to be forgiven!’</p>
<p>The next person in the solemn procession was the English forger; he
was a poor, miserable, lilylivered sort of fellow by nature, and on his first
detection and apprehension for the crime, of which he knew the certain
penalty, appeared (if I may use such an expression) almost <hi rend="i">disgustingly</hi>
afraid of death; but between his arrest and execution, he had been
attended with such exemplary diligence, judgment, and earnest and
affectionate benevolence, by an English missionary of the name of
  Smith,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a015">See note P.</xref></note> as to have undergone a revolution of character so complete
and astonishing, that it apparently comprised even his constitution of
body, and enabled him to evince a composure and even chastened joy in
his condition, which exceeded that of his military companion.</p>
<p>On leaving his cell, the following conversation was reported to have
passed between him and Mr. Smith, who attended him to the last. Mr.
Smith said to him, ‘I hope you are leaving a prison for a paradise to-day.’</p>
<p>He replied, ‘I have a paradise already.’ On looking forward to the
place of execution, he 
<pb n="233"/>
said, ‘I thought <hi rend="i">that</hi> sight would have sunk my heart, but God enables
me to sustain that too.’</p>
<p>‘You have now,’ said Mr. Smith, ‘entered on the last hour of
your earthly existence.’</p>
<p>‘I have,’ replied he, ‘but who would think that and look at me?
See, I any now all calmness and comfort. O, what happiness do I now
feel! How good is God to me! I have always dreaded the distress of soul
that I might feel at this, last hour, yet this is the best hour which I ever
had in my life. How good is God. He has kept the best blessings till the
last. He knew that I should want most comforts now. If he had given them
sooner, perhaps I might have slighted them, or trifled with them, but now
they are just what I want. O let me praise him! Almost every night,’
said he, ‘when I was in my cell, after my first introduction by you to an
acquaintance with the real nature of the Christian dispensation, my whole
life came in review, with a thousand things which I had not thought of for
many years, and all appeared so black and dreadful, that I scarcely dared
to hope; but I now see sin in all its odiousness, and would rather die than
run the risk, which I should by living, of a relapse into it, for I do believe
that my repentance is accepted, and that Jesus <hi rend="i">has</hi> paid my dreadful 
<pb n="234"/>
debt to the violated majesty of his Father, whom I may now therefore, without
presumption, call also mine; do tell my friends what I feel, it will make them
happy to hear it. I am astonished at the greatness of my own consolations. How
can a dying man be thus calm?’ Then holding out his arm, he said,
‘Look, not a nerve of my body trembles, and I have not a fear in my
soul!’</p>
<p>Mr. Smith reminded him, when he had taken his station to be shot, and
whilst kneeling on his coffin next the soldier, that he had always
encouraged him to hope that God would hear prayer, and support him at
the last hour.</p>
<p>He replied, ‘God has heard every prayer since I entered the prison
which we have just left; he has given me every thing for which I
  asked.’<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a016">See note Q.</xref></note></p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz followed to the ground the last prisoner, and being brought
before the governor, was asked, ‘Whether he was prepared freely to
give up the names of the parties in Outalissi's conspiracy, or to have
them wrung from him by the rack?’</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz said, ‘that he could not give up the names of men to
their vengeance, whom he believed, in his conscience, to have had no
other design than that of procuring redress for the most 
<pb n="235"/>
aggravated oppression and injustice, and who, if they had succeeded, would, he
was persuaded, have acted with a forbearance towards their enemies, and
jealousy of taking life, that would reflect shame upon most of the victories of
  soi-disant Christians.’<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a017">See note R.</xref></note></p>
<p>‘You hear his confession, governor,’ said Mr. Hogshead, who was
present, ‘he admits that he knows the negroes who were involved in
this diabolical conspiracy.’</p>
<p>‘If you will not give us their names,’ said the governor to Mr.
Schwartz, ‘I must bind you to the rack.’</p>
<p>‘Pain is terrible to the flesh,’ said Mr. Schwartz calmly, ‘but I
believe that God can support me even under the tortures which you
threaten, but if not, I will not betray to your vengeance those who have
suffered too much from you already, and whom I consider as innocent of
all guilt.’</p>
<p>‘Bind him to the rack,’ said the governor to the fellow in attendance
for that purpose. On the officers proceeding to the execution of this order,
the resolution of the glorious martyr seemed almost to fail him, a cold
sweat burst out from every pore, and a visible tremor pervaded his joints;

however he had the fortitude to submit himself to be bound to the wheel, and on
persisting in his silence, it was put in motion, and when his bones and joints
were all broken or dislocated, Mr. Hogshead asked him, ‘of what service his
friend Christ was to him then?’</p>
<p>‘I never,’ said Mr. Schwartz distinctly and firmly, ‘had so clear a
view of his glory, or such experience of his goodness and truth as at this
  moment,’ and expired with the last word.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a018">See note S.</xref></note></p>
<p>At length Outalissi was brought forward to the governor, and a fine study
he presented for an artist as he stood before him, his left leg advanced a
little like that of a soldier standing at ease; the length and grace of his
limbs well bound, with the exact proportion of muscle to give the utmost
possible degree of strength and vigour without clumsiness; the exquisite
cleanliness and beauty of the bent knee joint; the compact and firm, yet
agile loins, unloaded with the least excess of corpulence; the fine
convexing chest and corresponding shoulders, the Herculean strength of
the latter entirely relieved to the eye by a light graceful neck, surmounted
by features of luminous intelligence, and an expression of conscious self-sufficiency, which might have overawed a lion, 
<pb n="237"/>
left nothing wanting but a pedestal to make his whole figure rival, if not surpass,
the utmost powers of the chissel, each separate part of the noble structure
deriving from its indissociable connection and harmony with the whole the
vindication of its own propriety; so that every impulse of risibility, even to the
eye of a European unaccustomed to the naked exposure of the human person,
was overborne by the imposing dignity of the combined expression, and you felt
that artificial clothing would have been as ridiculous, and as much misplaced
upon Outalissi, as upon the statue of the Apollo Belvidere. The torture and death
of Mr. Schwartz he had surveyed with stern complacency, </p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>‘As monumental bronze unchang'd his look,</l>
<l>A soul that pity touch'd, but never shook,</l>
<l>Train'd, from his tree-rock'd cradle to his bier,</l>
<l>The fierce extremes of good and ill to brook;</l>
<l>Impassive - fearing but the shame of fear -</l>
<l>A stoic of the woods - a man without a tear.’</l></lg>
<p>Once only pronouncing, in a tone of bitter sarcasm, his climax of disgust
and loathing in the word <hi rend="sc">Christians</hi>!!! And when the governor pointing
to the body of the martyred missionary, asked him, if he was prepared
either to disclose his accomplices, or undergo a similar treatment? </p>
<pb n="238"/>
<p>he did not even deign to answer, and persisted in his indignant silence,
till Mr. Hogshead, whose rage had never yet been appeased for the
rescue from his grasp by Outalissi of poor Charlotte Venture, or the
constant repulse of his infamous advances by Charlotte herself, baffled in
the discovery of more victims to his resentment, and unable any longer to
restrain the expression of his disappointment, broke out into a torrent of
the most unmeasured and coarsest abuse, saying, ‘that the death of
Mr. Schwartz was much too good for a black rascal like that, that he
should be roasted by a slow fire, flayed, or buried alive up to his neck, or
have hot melted wax or lead poured upon his navel, or be hung up alive
to a gibbet by one of his ribs to feed the vultures, as used to be the mode
of execution in the time of Stedrnan; that to treat such a fellow with
humanity, that had nothing human about him but his shape, was a
perversion of the term.’ At this moment a letter from Miss Cotton was
put into the hands of Edward Bentinck, who stood close to the governor,
saying that her father was too ill to write himself, but had authorised her
to intreat Mr. Bentinck to make the governor acquainted with his
inextinguishable gratitude and obligations to Outalissi, in having, on two
separate occasions, at the ex-
<pb n="239"/>
treme risk of his own life, saved what was a thousand times dearer to him than
all his wealth, viz. the lives of both his children, and to explain to his excellency
the particulars of her brother's rescue from the tiger, and her own from the
blazing ship by Outalissi, and if pardon could not be extended to him, at least to
spare him all indignities and torture, that her agitation and hurry between the
confusion of the fire and her attendance on a sick parent, and the extreme
rapidity of the trial, conviction, and sentence of Mr. Schwartz and Outalissi, with
all of which she only became acquainted that morning, made it impossible for
her to apply to him before; that she had not perhaps the same right to interfere in
Mr. Schwartz's case, but should be glad either privately or publicly to express
her conviction in the Christian integrity and goodness of his intentions, and (if
there was yet time, although she feared there was not) to sign a petition, in which
also her father would join with his other friends for mercy. Almost at the same
moment when this letter was delivered to Mr. Bentinck, little Charles Cotton,
who had been stealing up to Outalissi, (having seen the crowd of persons, and
from the curiosity incident to children, followed the servant to the plain,) now
sprang upon his arm, but overcome 
<pb n="240"/>
with alarm by the appalling objects by which he was closely encircled, could not
utter a word, but bursting into tears, endeavoured to pull Outalissi away; and
when the governor, who knew the child, endeavoured to separate them, he only
clung the harder, and said, that if they did any harm to Outalissi he would tell his
papa, that Outalissi was not an ougry man, (the negro term for wicked,) that Mr.
Hogshead was an ougry man, and Outalissi a good man. The governor, who was
far from a bad hearted man in cases that came immediately under his own
observation, was a good deal struck, and indeed affected by so strong and totally
undesigning a testimony to the humanity and good qualities of Outalissi, which
Mr. Hogshead had so atrociously denied only the moment preceding, and
inquired into the occasion of such an extraordinary attachment to him by his
owner's child, which gave Edward Bentinck an opportunity of executing the
commission which he had just received, and his selection for which, by Miss
Cotton, made him but too happy.</p>
<p>‘Take away those instruments of hell!’ said the governor, when
Edward Bentinck had finished his narration. ‘Outalissi! it is impossible
for me to spare your life consistently with my duty to the colony, the
safety of which must at all times 
<pb n="241"/>
and in all cases be my first object, and of that safety you are the confessed and
open enemy; but you have heard the application that has been made for you, and
the instances of your personal courage and humanity that have been so
opportunely testified by your late owner's family; your character as a man now
stands redeemed from all imputation, and I shall treat you as an open but
honourable enemy, and be satisfied with inflicting on you a soldier's death,
therefore disengage yourself from the child, and kneel with the two first
prisoners upon your coffin.</p>
<p>‘Governor!’ said Outalissi, for a single moment subdued to tears,
‘I could have borne any torture, but this unexpected kindness unmans
me. Death is nothing to me with honour, life nothing to me without, and
since the great Spirit which is over all has thus vindicated my character,
and proved to you decisively that I am not the monster which that bad
man would make me out to be, but susceptible of some at least of the
noblest feelings of our common nature; I cheerfully embrace the death
you offer me, in the fullest confidence that there is another world, in
which, if you are only acting as honestly up to your convictions of duty, as
I have strove (however often unsuccessfully) to fulfil mine, it is appointed
by the 
<pb n="242"/>
goodness of that awful Spirit, the common Judge and Father of us all, that we
should meet again. Shades of my fathers! pardon these tears,</p>
<lg type="poem">
  <l>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The last, the first,</l>
<l>The only tears that ever burst</l>
<l>From Outalissi's soul.’</l>
</lg>
<p>Having then persuaded little Charles Cotton to return home on the
assurance that he was only going back to his own country; and that, if he
was a good, boy, he should one day or other infallibly see him again, he
took his station kneeling on his coffin in a line with his two companions,
earnestly refusing to have his eyes bound, in which also he was indulged.
The platoon instructed for the purpose were marched into a line opposite
about thirty yards off, the intermediate space cleared of the <hi rend="i">amateurs</hi>, the
signal given, and in less than five minutes afterwards the four men were
inclosed in their coffins and graves, the military dismissed, the concourse
vanished, and no vestige either of them or the morning's spectacle visible
in this temporal world.</p>
<p>Amongst the reflections suggested to Edward Bentinck on his return to
his apartments in the barracks, from the solemn duties in which he had
just borne a part, were the following: - How much 
<pb n="243"/>
more efficient is the support derived in the near prospect of death from those
views of Christianity which rest their claims to the confidence of the disciple,
simply on the acquiescence of his own heart in the unearthly purity of its
precepts, and the adaptation of its doctrines to the actual moral defects of his
nature, than from those which exclusively address themselves to the satisfaction
of the reason. In this respect the Papist and the English sectarian are much more
successful auxiliaries in the preparation of the mind for its last exercise of faith,
than the minister of the English Protestant establishment; the former accustom
their pupils to try the truth of the creed they propose for their acceptance, simply
by its correspondence with the dicta of their own self-disabused conscience, and
there is something in that mystical moral department of our nature which we
vulgarly call heart, which responds loudly, distinctly, and <hi rend="i">affirmatively</hi> to the
appeal. All captious objections, all self-vindicatory fetches, all merely
speculative doubts advanced in the spirit of disputation, they overbear with the
authoritative tone of sensible conviction. ‘This IS life eternal, to know
Thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.’
The consequence
<pb n="244"/>
of doubting or disbelief must therefore be the converse of eternal life. A
man therefore, who is accustomed to repose his confidence in the truth of
christianity principally on such impressions, has the evidence always
within himself; and like love, fear, anger, or any other natural affection,
ready to spring forth at a moment's notice with an energy proportioned to
the importance of the exciting occasion.</p>
<p>Edward Bentinck considered himself both by habit and attachment a
member of the church of England, and thought even its articles (if an
attempt must be made to define what was perhaps never intended for
definition by human language) as little exceptionable, and varying as little
from the essential truths of christianity as possible. He thought also, that
the majority of its clergy were men of unimpeachable moral integrity, and
some of ‘the salt of the earth;’ but there was something in their
mode of discharging their duties, a shyness of the subject of religion in
conversation, and a timid caution of the slightest deviation from
prescribed formulæ, that always conveyed to his mind a doubt of their
<hi rend="i">own confidence</hi> in the doctrines, of which they were the appointed
communicators to the public - they seem entirely to overlook the
<hi rend="i">secondary</hi> character of the support sup-
<pb n="245"/>
plied them by the state, and to be afraid of referring their authority and
commissions to Him, whose recognition of them could alone make them
genuine, and of which temporal government consistently with the truth of
christianity (id est) with its right to interfere at all, could only provide external
facilities for the exercise, to confide, in fact, more in their human than divine
armour, and to be afraid, if they should dismantle themselves of the first, of
challenging infidelity to a combat with the other. Nobly jealous of the slightest
hypocrisy, they disdain to affect a confidence or unction which they do not feel,
and cannot therefore possibly excite in others. They do not urge men to the
shelter of the cross as they would call them from a crust of snow over a gulph in
a glacier; a blazing dwelling or a sinking ship, a moment's demur in the change
of your position, may be fatal. <hi rend="i">There</hi> is destruction, <hi rend="i">here</hi> is salvation; they must
themselves feel confident of both before they can place them in sufficiently
startling antithesis to each other to produce any extensive effect. ‘But
whence is it,’ thought Edward Bentinck, ‘that the clergy of the
church of England <hi rend="i">are</hi> less confident in the truth of their professed
principles than other Christian ministers?’ This question he could only
explain to himself by 
<pb n="246"/>
supposing the opposition to implicit credulity, in which their separation from the
church of Rome originated, to give to their education too great a bias towards a
spirit of philosophical and demonstration-demanding inquiry, and to make the
ground of their faith too exclusively the rational evidences of christianity; which,
although affording a preponderance of evidence in favour of its truth, so strong,
that it would be unreasonable in any one not to act upon a presumption of equal
strength in any of the common concerns of life, cannot amount to <hi rend="i">certainty</hi>. The
immense field of research and science which these evidences embrace, and the
very confined periscope of the most powerful and highly cultivated mind, make
it impossible that any one can be <hi rend="i">sure</hi>, in any question of this nature, that no
object of essential estimate in an incontrovertible judgment has been overlooked;
that there is nothing beyond the compass of his present mental horizon, which, if
admitted into view, might alter the comparative value and relative appearance of
things present to his examination; he can never, therefore, feel the repose of
<hi rend="i">absolute certainly</hi> from such evidences, and by habitually rejecting any other
species of evidence than that which addresses itself to the reason, he seems to
exclude himself from that most valu-
<pb n="247"/>
able of all, viz. the Spirit of God testifying with his Spirit that <hi rend="i">he has</hi> passed
from death unto life; for surely this evidence must be one of impression upon the
heart. How defective, indeed, would be a revelation designed for the poor, as
well as the rich, without some evidence independent of mental capacity and
scientific acquirement. It is well indeed, as far as we can, to pursue both species
of evidence, and for every one, to the utmost of his ability, to employ his reason
as well for the confirmation of his faith as for its correction, and restraint from
extravagance; but for any one to accustom himself to regard the reasonable
evidences of christianity as the only admissible ground of satisfactory
confidence in its truth, is to accustom himself to look to reason for what it cannot
give, and therefore to deny himself all joy and peace in believing, of which
humility, prayer, and obedience, are a much safer and better source, even if
demonstration upon such a subject were within the power and province of
reason, which it is not. Obedience is, perhaps, always the safest and surest path
to religious knowledge; but next to that, the deep self-abasement and humility
which, if the knowledge be genuine, will be found infallibly either to precede or
  follow it.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a019">See note T.</xref></note></p>

</lg>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> morning after the execution, Edward Bentinck called at the
apartments of Mr. Cotton in</p>
<p>the gaol, to acquaint him and his daughter with the proceedings of the
preceding morning, and the result of his application to the governor in
obedience to the wishes which had been conveyed to him in Miss
Cotton's letter. On his entrance, Matilda was sitting by the side of the bed
to which her father, from the rapid declension of his strength, was now
almost entirely confined; and although the former was herself in a
considerable fever from the agitation in which her spirits had 
<pb n="249"/>
been kept since she came to Paramaribo, the expression of pensive
melancholy in her beautiful countenance, lighted by a momentary flush of
animation, and perhaps even indefinable hope and pleasure on the
appearance of Edward, the perfect symmetry and graceful composure of
her person, the elegant simplicity, chastity, and propriety of her dress, the
exquisite cleanliness and beauty of her luxuriant hair, contrasted with the
strong lines of self-corrosion and disquietude which prevailed in the
masculine features of Mr. Cotton, inflamed by a high fever and the
irritation of great bodily pain; as well as the grated window and
dungeonlike appearance of the room, although furnished with as much
comfort as wealth could contrive in such a place, made her look less like
an inhabitant of the earth than heaven, and conveyed to the spectator's
imagination the idea of the guardian angel of the sufferer, waiting for the
tear of penitence which should open the gates of paradise to his
reclaimed and rescued spirit.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Bentinck,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘although you see the state to
which you have brought me, I should not have died in peace without an
opportunity of thanking you for your exertions during the fire, in the
rescue of a life compared with which, as you well know, (notwithstanding
the 
<pb n="250"/>
contrast of our minds upon some subjects,) I have ever lightly regarded my own;
I mean, that of the dear child that now sits by me.’</p>
<p>‘My exertions on that occasion,’ said Edward, ‘were more than
repaid to my own heart by their success, if you would allow them now so
far to plead for me as to procure for me your attention, and it would not
exhaust you to indulge me with it for a few minutes, whilst I explain the
appearance of duplicity which I fear in your estimation must naturally
have attended my instrumentality in your present situation, you would
make me the only return I should ever presume to ask for them.’</p>
<p>‘I shall listen to you with pleasure,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘as I have
ever thought too well of you not to rejoice in the vindication of your
character from the injurious effect of any conduct that appeared unworthy
of a man of honour. With regard to the slave trade, Matilda has put the
guilt of it in such a light to me since my confinement to this place, that at
all events I renounce it for ever , but still considering the footing you were
upon with us at Anne's Grove, there seemed something of treachery in
your denouncing us to the government without any intimation of your
intention.’</p>
<p>The time having now expired during which Edward Bentinck had bound
himself to secrecy, and 
<pb n="251"/>
having received besides a message from his informant that morning, to say that
he was now safe again on board his old favourite sloop, the Saucy Anne, and to
release him consequently from his engagement of suppressing his name, of
which he might therefore make whatever use he pleased; Edward had no longer
any scruple of explaining the equivocal appearances which he confessed were
rather against him, by a plain statement of the motives and circumstances by
which he had been influenced; namely, that he had, inadvertently perhaps,
committed himself to a solemn assurance of concealing the name of his
informant (which of course rendered him obnoxious to the suspicion that the
information originated with himself) before he knew that it implicated Mr.
Cotton, or indeed any thing of its import; that he could not give Mr. Cotton any
warning of his impeachment without the danger of his communicating it to
Captain Légere, time enough to have enabled him to escape with his vessel. That
the implacable unscrupulous vengeance with which such a man would have
pursued the author of his information, if he had suspected it to have been a
friendless British seaman in a foreign colony, was as well known to Mr. Cotton
as to himself. That he (Mr. Bentinck) knew further, that the punishment of slave-
<pb n="252"/>
trading by the Dutch laws did not extend to life, but merely to a fine of five
  thousand guilders and five years' imprisonment;<note n="*" place="foot"> It has lately been increased to ten thousand guilders fine, and fifteen
    years hard labour. - <hi rend="i">Note by the Editor</hi>.</note> the former of which he
knew could not have occasioned to a man of Mr. Cotton's substance one hour's
anxiety; and of the latter he had every reason to believe that his influence with
the colonial authorities would ensure a mitigation, if not (after a little time) a
total remission. At the same time he would not deny that the trade was so full of
enormity in his opinion, so revolting to every sentiment of humanity, and in such
daring defiance of the laws of God, written upon every man's natural conscience,
as well as both the letter and spirit of revealed religion, that, before he received
the deposition of the British sailor, he sometimes felt that he could not have
deferred much longer acquainting government with what fell under his own
observation, without contracting negatively a very considerable degree of guilt;
that, in that case however he should certainly have previously expressed to Mr.
Cotton the impossibility of his conniving at it in future, consistently with his
sense of duty either to God or man, but which, in the present case, the promise
exacted from him by his informant had prevented; that, at all events, when Mr.
Cotton 
<pb n="253"/>
reflected that the step he had taken was at the imminent risk of an irreparable
rupture with him, and of the consequent sacrifice of all further intercourse with
his family, for one member of which he would no longer affect to conceal the
devotion of heart which he had cherished, and the hopes (which, in spite of his
frequent challenge to himself of their presumption and unattainableness) he had
irresistibly indulged, he felt confident that he would at least admit that he had
acted in obedience to a stern sense of disinterested duty, and in denial of every
personal inclination, however mistaken or extravagant he might think his views
of duty upon the particular practice in question.</p>
<p>‘Well, Mr. Bentinck,’ said Mr. Cotton, (the expression of severe
pain on his features relaxing for a moment into a smile of half playful
benignity; for he had not been blind to the mutual impressions made upon
each other by Edward and Matilda, and independently of what he had
hitherto considered as Edward's abuse of hospitality in originating an
information against him for what he had observed during his visits to the
plantation, did not feel any insurmountable objection to their indulgence,)
‘I confess you have placed the disinterestedness of your motives in so
strong a point of view as to incline me at any rate to acquit your 
<pb n="254"/>
honour; but perhaps, if I acquit your honour, it must be at the expense of your
gallantry; for in defending yourself, you seem to expose one of my own most
confidential subjects to the charge of a sort of misprision of treason, or at least a
concealment of something upon which it would have been both her wisdom and
duty to consult me. - What do you think, Matilda? Did Mr. Bentinck ever make
such a confession to you before as that which is comprised in the latter part of
what you have just heard from him?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, papa,’ said Matilda, with the unembarrassed gracefulness
and simplicity of truth and conscious integrity; ‘he did before we left the
country, but I charged him never to recur to the subject, and would not
but in your presence, or with your knowledge, even have received from
him any explanation of that part of his conduct from which we have all so
much suffered.’</p>
<p>There was a little something of reproach in the expression
accompanying this reply of Matilda, which excited in Edward a
considerable doubt whether his vindication had been as satisfactory to
her as it appeared to her father; or whether it arose (which is more
probable, as young ladies are very tenacious of their prerogatives in such
points) from a dislike of being taken by surprise rather, in 
<pb n="255"/>
such a confession on his part, which was necessarily calculated to extort from
her a more unreserved and irrevocable disclosure of her own heart than she
might otherwise perhaps have so soon chosen to confide to him.</p>
<p>‘If,’ said Edward, ‘the declaration of ardent admiration of Miss
Cotton, which I have just made, appears a little too abrupt, I beg to
disclaim the slightest intention or desire of drawing through you any reply
from her unless she is perfectly prepared to bestow one. I earnestly trust
you will neither of you so misinterpret me as to suppose me capable of
such a design. You cannot, I think, but see that I had scarcely an
alternative of avowing it, as it was a fact of indispensable importance to
my exculpation, or at least to the demonstration of the disinterestedness
and purity of my motives in those steps by which I have had the
misfortune to incur a forfeiture, or rather, as I would still earnestly hope, a
suspension of your good opinion and confidence.’</p>
<p>‘Mr. Bentinck,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘to a question of such extreme
moment to my daughter's happiness as that implied in your candid
explanation of this morning, I will take upon myself at once to answer for
her, as I think I am sufficiently in possession of her sentiments, although
she has never 
<pb n="256"/>
formally communicated them to me, and I know that I am sufficiently sensible of
her inestimable worth and goodness to justify and require me to exercise one of
the most important and responsible duties of parental authority. That the effects
of your philanthropy have in one particular extended farther than you
contemplated, I will not for a moment dispute; for I have little doubt that I shall
be the victim of it. There is something within me that convinces me that I shall
never leave this prison, at the same time I begin to fear that most of my
principles, and the personal conduct which has been the necessary fruit of them
in other respects, besides the practice of the slave trade, are very indefensible;
and if my forebodings are true I have but a short time to attempt any atonement,
let me at least by one act of magnanimity before I die redeem my character from
utter obloquy. Matilda! my dear, give me your hand! Mr. Bentinck! the good
opinion with which I have always regarded you is now completely confirmed. I
am satisfied that you are a man of truth, honour, and courage; and if I did not
think it would be a profanation of religion in a man of my habits to presume to
judge of it, I would add conscientious Christianity, and I know my daughter
entertains the same opinion of you. Take, this hand - Ma-
<pb n="257"/>
tilda, my dear, do not now for the first time in your life refuse me your obedience
- I confidently commit its owner to your protection and constancy, but remember
it is upon one condition, viz. that you relinquish your profession. You will find
yourself amply provided for without it.’</p>
<p>‘My dear papa!’ cried Matilda, as she extended her hand across
the bed to Edward Bentinck, at the same time hiding her face in her
father's bosom, and bursting into tears, ‘you have always been too
good to me.’</p>
<p>As for our hero, quite unprepared by the commencement of Mr. Cotton's
speech for the benevolence of its conclusion, and overpowered by the
conflicting emotions of regret for the state into which he felt that he had
(however innocently) brought him, gratitude for his inestimable
benefaction, admiration of his magnanimity, the deepest devotion of
attachment, amounting almost to adoration of Matilda, soldier as he was,
he must either have sunk upon the ground or given way to a flood of
tears, if he had not rushed out of the room; he could only press to his
heart and lips the hand which had been given him, and stammer out,
‘this is too much sir,’ as he relinquished it, but not till a single tear
had fallen on the back of it, 
<pb n="258"/>
which its lovely owner did not disdain to leave unreproved in its possession.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more distressing or embarrassing than the situation of
Matilda, in regard to the duty of impressing upon her father's attention the
subject of religion. The crisis of tropical fevers may often be fatally
determined by agitation of mind. The physicians, therefore, are always
enjoining the patient and his friends to avoid every topic which has the
least tendency to produce discomposure. Hitherto, therefore, satisfied
with the repeated promise which she had exacted of the medical
attendants that they would inform her the moment they apprehended any
danger, Matilda had cautiously abstained from adverting to Mr. Cotton's
infidelity; but she was too good a nurse not to know that a presentiment
in the patient himself of a fatal issue to such a fever was the most
unequivocal symptom of danger, and indeed sure almost (if there was
none otherwise) to realize itself. Knowing also how unscrupulously
medical men often practise deception with regard to danger where they
apprehend any prejudicial consequences from its disclosure, both upon
the patient and his family, she determined not to delay another moment in
the discharge of what she con-
<pb n="259"/>
sidered a duty paramount to all. As soon, therefore, as Mr. Bentinck was
withdrawn, - ‘My dear papa,’ said she, ‘for my sake you must not
indulge such desponding opinions of your situation as you just now
expressed. The doctors assure me there is no danger: now, therefore,
whilst you cannot suppose it to proceed from any such apprehension on
my part, I have a request to prefer, your compliance with which will
contribute more to the promotion of my peace and happiness than all
your former bounties, even than that anticipation of my heart's inmost
wishes (as I will now confess it to be) that you have made this morning; it
  is that you would allow me to send for Mr. Austin,<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a020">See Note U.</xref></note> and hear how far
he can satisfy your objections to the truth of Christianity. He is a
clergyman of the church of England, and you know some traits in his
character, which your own disdain of sycophancy has always inclined you
to appreciate.’</p>
<p>‘O! my dear child,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘do not press me upon that
point; my objections can never be satisfied. If any one could convince me
of the truth of Christianity, you would: the sweet consistency and purity of
such a life as yours has 
<pb n="260"/>
more weight with me than folios of written argument; were all nominal
Christians like you, the influence of its principles upon the happiness of society
would be so benign as to comprise in itself an overbearing evidence of its divine
origin.’</p>
<p>‘But all people have some moral belief, papa,’ said Matilda;
‘some standard of moral responsibility to which they but partially
conform their conduct? Why should the inconsistencies of Christians be a
greater evidence against the truth of their creed, than the inconsistencies
of infidels against the truth of theirs?’</p>
<p>‘Not greater,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘but it <hi rend="i">is</hi> an evidence against all,
therefore I believe none, or at least doubt all.’</p>
<p>‘O! papa,’ said Matilda, ‘don't do yourself so much injustice. I
know you believe in the value of some of the noblest principles of social
morality - the sanctity of confidence, the obligation of pecuniary
punctuality, the meanness of deceit, subterfuge, and sycophancy, the
dignity and nobleness of truth; but to make it obvious that the
inconsistency of its professors is no argument against the truth of any
faith, does it, for example, afford the slightest evidence to the conscience
of any one that murder is not a crime of the deepest dye, and obnoxious
to the vengeance of heaven, that indi-
<pb n="261"/>
viduals frequently commit it notwithstanding their intimate conviction of its
guilt?’</p>
<p>Matilda did not mean by this illustration to excite any train of personal
reflections in her father in reference to the wholesale murder practised in
the slave trade, (although she had before endeavoured to make him see
it in that light,) as he probably had never considered the unhappy
Africans as fellow creatures, - or to the case of her broken-hearted
mother, or any other case of <hi rend="i">indirect</hi> instrumentality in the destruction of
life; but conscience is very quick and faithful in her exemplifications, and
after a momentary struggle with himself, which appeared to give him
great pain and a transient expression of anger, Mr. Cotton said, ‘You
are right, Matilda! <hi rend="i">that</hi> vengeance has now overtaken your unhappy
father - send for a clergyman.’</p>
<p>Overjoyed at having gained this great point with her father, Matilda could
only say, ‘it is impossible, papa, that such constant goodness as yours
to me should not draw down a blessing upon yourself,’ and once more
kissing him amidst her tears, and inwardly offering to heaven a fervent
deprecation of the vengeance of which he had expressed a fear, she left
him to despatch a note to Mr. Austin, in which she requested his
attendance 
<pb n="262"/>
in the evening, and it was not many hours before the arrival of that gentleman (in
willing obedience to the summons which he had received) was announced.</p>
<p>As the clergyman approached Mr. Cotton's bed the latter said to him,
‘I have sent for you, sir; perhaps only to increase the bitterness of
death by inviting you to demonstrate the truth of a system by which I must
be condemned. Still to shut his eyes to the light is the part of neither a
brave man nor an honest one. I confess to you that I have been for many
years an infidel in the truth of Christianity, and have acted in too much
defiance of its restraints; but as I now believe myself to be dying, I will not
disguise that I am not without considerable misgivings as to many both of
my opinions and practices.</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>“Faults in the life breed errors in the brain,</l>
<l>And these reciprocally those again.”</l>
</lg>
<p>I do not wish to go out of life under a false peace, or an impotent
bravado, and as I think I have courage to look my condition fairly in the
face, however desperate; will you state to me as shortly as you can the
sources from which you derive the most satisfactory evidence to your
own mind of the truth of that extraordinary dispensation 
<pb n="263"/>
which, in some of its provisions, is just what a man in my situation stands in
need of, if he could but convince himself of their reality.’</p>
<p>‘I derive my conviction,’ said Mr. Austin, ‘from within and from
without, from the response of every honest heart to the anti-selfish and
unearthly purity of the spirit, and the precepts of Christianity; had it been
of earth, its doctrines, like those of all other religions, must have been
more sensual; but all its tendencies being heavenward, from heaven it
must have sprung. I derive it from the existence of evil; at every step,
even of life's purest enjoyments, <hi rend="i">surgit aliquid amari</hi>; whence is this,
unless as Christianity explains it, evil must be inherent in the Being who
is the author of evil. To ascribe evil to the author of nature, therefore, is to
ascribe to Him defect, for evil is defect, and defect is irreconcileable to
the perfection manifested in his works, and to the limits which are
evidently set to the irruptions of evil upon that perfection by some power
superior to <hi rend="i">its</hi> author. The author of evil, therefore, must be the enemy of
the author of nature, and have superinduced it upon his works; what
solution, therefore of this great moral phenomenon can be offered to us
more probable and agreeable to reason, more analogous to our own
innate sense of justice, 
<pb n="264"/>
than that which is presented by Christianity and Christianity alone: viz. that the
struggle which man is involved in, between good and evil, is the result of his
having lent himself to the designs of some enemy, both of his maker and himself,
and thereby implicated himself in his guilt, and inextricably entangled himself
(inextricably by his own powver) in his punishment, and in a state of perpetual
collision with the will of God; that his present state is, therefore necessarily, one
as well of moral penalty as moral discipline. But, blessed be God, there is for
man a provision of moral recovery and mercy, of which every individual has,
probably, the same freedom of availing himself as he would have had to stand or
fall, had he stood in the place of our first progenitors. Free agency is
indispensable to moral intelligence, without it man could not have heen a moral
being, the next descending link of animated creation being that of instinct. The
<hi rend="i">possibility</hi> of falling was essential to free agency, Satan fell irredeemably,
because of his own inherent pravity - his own ungoverned lust of power and
knowledge; man fell, but not solely by his own impatience of controul, but by
the seduction of another. That some mystery on the origin and <hi rend="i">permission</hi> of
evil, and the mode of countervailing it, as well as other points, still re-
<pb n="265"/>
mains unexplained by Christianity, is not because in themselves they do not
admit of explanation, or because the divine founder and object of the Christian
faith could not have explained them to a <hi rend="i">commensurate</hi> order of intelligence, but
because an intelligence so finite as man's could not have comprehended the
explanation, if given, or a language so finite have conveyed it; can any human
science be explained to an individual of which the principles exceed his
capacity? That there must be subjects which exceed all finite capacities, is self-evident, or the capacities would not be finite, but infinite. That some mystery,
therefore, should remain unremoved in a religion professing to explain man's
moral relationship to his maker; the connection of finite intelligences with an
infinite intelligence, and of things finite with infinitude, so far from being a
rational objection to its truth, seems essential to it, and rather a presumption in
its favour, if the explanation, as far as it goes, is homogeneal to man's moral
nature and the circumstances in which he actually stands. That man is a fallen
creature, a moral ruin, that some great lapse has prostrated his rational dignity -
some great change superseded his original moral conformation; - surely,
surely,’ continued Mr. Austin, ‘is a fact, which acquires more and
more 
<pb n="266"/>
incontestability to every one's daily experience of himself and others, and the
impression of which is co-progressive with the growth and expansion of the
understanding, from childhood or barbarism to maturity and general knowledge,
whence otherwise is our universal conception of ideals, of moral purity, and
excellence, of which the present world supplies no realisation? A union of
goodness and happiness, which the old often ascribe to the young, and the young
to the old, which even bad men sometimes sigh for, and good men (although
distantly) approach? Whence, I ask, these models of ideal excellence in every
human bosom - this perception of moral beauty, unless from the outlines of a
nobler original structure being still perspicuous to the melancholy spirit that now
so painfully occupies its ruins? Surely then, what all the best men hope for, <hi rend="i">may</hi>
be true; what none but bad men wish fallacious, <hi rend="i">must</hi>.’</p>
<p>‘You stagger me, sir,’ interrupted Mr. Cotton; ‘but, oh, if
Christianity <hi rend="i">is</hi> the divine key for the solution of the moral phenomena of
our nature, why are not its evidences written upon the sun and moon, that
all doubt in all, might be overborne by sensible proof?’</p>
<p>‘Because, sir,’ said Mr. Austin, ‘a faith so <hi rend="i">compelled</hi> (id est, by
miracle and sensible evidence 
<pb n="267"/>
exclusively) would comprehend no such subduction of man's reasoning pride,
no such discipline of his understanding or heart, as invariably results from the
honest and patient exercise of both in the examination of the evidences as they
now stand; if, indeed, the decalogue were inscribed upon the sun, men would
scarcely deny its divine authority, but they would evade its design or excuse
their disobedience of it, or by some commutation of its spirit for its letter,
entirely defeat all its practical value, as the Jews invariably did. Besides, surely,
it is more consistent that some portion at least of the evidences of a dispensation,
designed for an intelligent being, should be of a nature (such as history and
prophecy) to address themselves rather to his rational than his animal faculties.
But that nothing might be wanting to satisfy an honest heart of the divine origin
of Christianity, and meet any sincere doubt that might arise from consciousness
of the limited periscope of the human reason, and a distrust in the sufficiency of
its powers, upon historical and moral evidence alone, to decide so-much-involving a question, the miracles which accompanied its introduction to the
world are abundant, and abundantly attested; - and one perpetual miracle
(including at once the evidence of both miracle and prophecy) still continually 
<pb n="268"/>
presses itself upon our attention in the actual state and condition of the Jews. But
those who would urge as a plea for their infidelity a diffidence in the competence
of their own power and learning, to appreciate the arguments in favour of
Christianity, I would earnestly remind of the number of illustrious human
witnesses that have lived and died in the profession of its faith to defer nothing
to whose opinion is surely inconsistent in such infidels with the admission of
their own subordinate capacity: not to go back into the early ages of the church
and attempt to enumerate the noble army of martyrs, or even beyond our own
protestant country, I would merely remind them of such names as Bacon, Boyle,
Locke, Milton, Baxter, Hale, Newton, Jenyns, Jones, Johnson, Chillingworth,
  Watts, Doddridge, Warburton, Horseley, Porteus, and Paley.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a021">See Note X.</xref></note> Now, these
men and a host of other Christian advocates, both conformists and
nonconformists, with whose names I am less familiar, but perhaps equally
entitled to deference, either <hi rend="i">disbelieved</hi> or did <hi rend="i">not</hi> <hi rend="i">disbelieve</hi>. If they <hi rend="i">disbelieved</hi>,
they were the worst of hypocrites, in systematically upholding a faith which they
believed to be a wild delusion and imposture, and lending their great names to
the en-
<pb n="269"/>
slavement of men's reason and consciences, and the entanglement of their own
lives in a system of restraints and observances which they saw clearly to he
nothing more than vain superstitions. If, on the other hand, they did <hi rend="i">not
disbelieve</hi>, then the concurrent testimony of so many men of such undeniable
competence to the estimation of moral and historical evidence, affords a
presumption in favour of those evidences; to deny the force and weight of which
amounts in any inferior mind to a degree of arrogance and self-sufficiency, little
short of absurdity. Or if the infidel chooses to take the other horn of the
dilemma, and consider them as positive hypocrites; it seems to imply on his part
a very offensive degree of pharisaism and want of candour; besides, the whole
lives of some of them and the earnest style of their professions and publications
on the subject of Christianity are in direct and decisive contradiction to such a
supposition. I see but one plausible escape open to the infidel from this dilemma,
he may possibly say that despairing of eradicating superstition altogether from
the human breast, they thought it wise not to disturb its possession by the most
benevolent or least harmless, or that the danger of unsettling established
opinions amongst the vulgar was more than equivalent to any probable good,
and that to 
<pb n="270"/>
do so might, perhaps, be only displacing one error to be succeeded by another,
and perhaps a worse. In reply, I contend, that such an hypothesis would scarcely
vindicate the moral integrity of such men, who as philosophers and disciples of
truth, were bound by all the best interests of man to expose falsehood wherever
they had <hi rend="i">conclusively</hi> detected it; but, at all events, such a supposition would
only explain their <hi rend="i">tacit</hi> acquiescence in the prevailing opinions - their <hi rend="i">negative</hi>
concurrence; but to suppose that such men would enter into long painful
expositions of Christianity and expend their valuable time and searching powers
in the strenuous and solemn defence of it, when they know it to be false, does
equal violence to common sense and common honesty.’</p>
<p>‘But how is it,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘that the progress of Christianity,
during the long lapse of eighteen hundred years since its introduction,
has been so very incommensurate with the omnipotence of its Author (if,
indeed, its Author be <hi rend="sc">Omnipotence</hi>), that it does not yet comprise
even nominally a fourth part of the population of the world?’</p>
<p>‘<hi rend="i">Numerically</hi>, certainly not,’ said Mr. Austin, ‘but if you make
intelligence the measure of the Christian and infidel world, it is clear that
nominal 
<pb n="271"/>
Christendom contains by far the largest portion, and you must remember that it
was indispensable to the accompaniment of such a dispensation by one of its
most valuable and satisfactory evidences (viz. prophecy), that it should be both
<hi rend="i">time-born </hi>and <hi rend="i">progressive</hi>.’</p>
<p>‘One word more,’ said Mr. Cotton; ‘Why, O, why, if those who
profess and call themselves Christians, are really such, do not their
doctrines and their lives coincident exhibit more lucid <hi rend="i">proof</hi> than they do
of their sincerity?’</p>
<p>‘Christianity itself answers the question,’ said Mr. Austin;
‘<hi rend="i">perfect</hi> consistency of obedience, whilst the soul of man remains
attached to a body of sin and death, is perhaps impossible. God gave a
perfect law; what could he less? declaring at the same time, by the spirit
of his own comments upon it, that he would estimate the character of his
subjects, not even by the proximity of their conduct to a perfect
conformity to so high a standard, but by the earnestness and
perseverance of their efforts to approach it. For, one man, by
complacency of natural constitution and favour of fortune, may be
advanced higher on the scale to human eyes, by a much less effort than
it has cost another, less propitiously composed or circum-
<pb n="272"/>
stanced to reach a lower grade; <hi rend="i">therefore</hi>, spiritual judgment is forbidden to
Christians of each other, and the charity that hopeth all things is enjoined.
Besides,’ continued Mr. Austin, ‘you, sir, no doubt, as well as every
other man, have some moral belief; allow me to ask you, have you
always acted up to your own belief of your duty? (whatever that belief
may have been); because, if not, you see, the apparent discrepancy
between the profession and practise of some Christians, is no more
evidence of the falsehood of their belief, than the inconsistency of your
conduct with your principles is of the falsehood of yours; indeed, if theirs
is a higher, and more comprehensive, and difficult standard of moral duty
than yours, not so much by whatever is the difference in those respects;
<hi rend="i">insincerity</hi>, therefore not <hi rend="i">inconsistency</hi>, in a creature so full of weakness
and moral gravitation (if I may be allowed such an expression) as man, is
the only proof either of hypocrisy in him or falsehood in his principles,
however defective his obedience to them.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, I <hi rend="sc">Believe</hi>,’ said Mr. Cotton, after a pause of a minute. The
reader, who has ever noticed the sudden burst of a sweet landscape from
the deep and sombre gloom of a severe im-
<pb n="273"/>
pending shower into the bright beams of a summer sun, may imagine the
effect of this exclamation of Mr. Cotton on the beautiful features of his
daughter, the lines of which had been strained into an expression of
intense and almost fixed anxiety, during the progress of this discussion,
from the all absorbing importance of the point at issue. But occupied by
the impression made by the external advocate, and unable to measure
exactly the powerful co-operation of the still and silent, but strong and
faithful advocate within, in her delightful surprise at the surrender of her
father's prejudices so much sooner than she had dared to hope, and
struck with admiration at the candour and magnanimity of such a
confession, from the noble sacrifice of pride which it involved, after an
opposition almost throughout his life; for she knew that not a particle of
fear entered into the grounds of his conviction, and that if he suspected
himself of yielding an iota to such an influence he would never have
confessed his conviction, or</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>‘Mock'd God's Throne with prayer</l>
<l>Wrung from the coward crouching of despair;’</l>
</lg>
<p>she could not help regarding him in a light with which, although always
kind and affectionate to her, 
<pb n="274"/>
her imagination had never been able to surround him before - a light of moral
grandeur, and throwing herself upon her knees, ‘Now, papa,’ said she,
‘you have indeed rewarded me, this is what I have watched and wept
for daily, nightly, and I may almost say hourly, since the loss of her whose
place I now so ill supply by your bedside; but, perhaps, I do not supply it,
perhaps her spirit now contemplates yours, and with the other angels of
God, O, more than shares my joy at the great change now produced;’
then raising her irradiated eyes to heaven, ‘but <hi rend="sc">Thou</hi>,’ she said,
‘Benignant Saviour; do'st all things well, <hi rend="sc">Thou</hi> makest both the blind
to see, the deaf to hear, and the dumb to praise <hi rend="sc">Thee</hi>!!!’</p>
<p>‘Matilda, my love,’ said Mr. Cotton, struggling to controul some
new emotions which her affectionate fervour had excited, ‘I dare not
trust myself just yet to the hopes you have suggested, and if you pursue
the subject, I fear you will unman me, which might hereafter lead me to
suspect my present judgment, from the possibility of the integrity of my
mind having been impaired by some delusion of the senses. In faith I am
now a sincere Christian, the concurrence of the external with the internal
evidence, the actual moral state 
<pb n="275"/>
of the world, with the explanation of it afforded by Christianity, and Christianity
alone; the arguments derived from history and prophecy, with the other points,
so succinctly but perspicuously expressed by Mr. Austin, do seem to me to
comprise at least a preponderance of evidence, which must overbear any
reasonable and honest objections; my only astonishment is, how I could contrive
so long to shut the light out of my own heart. My doubts are now all transferred
to the possibility of the admission of so late and unworthy a disciple as myself to
its unspeakable mercies. What, sir,’ addressing Mr. Austin, ‘is the
disposition required of a convert like me to qualify him for partaking
without presumption of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper?’</p>
<p>‘Exactly what is required of all other communicants,’ replied Mr.
Austin, ‘and which is so appositely expressed in the Church
Catechism, (viz.) to examine yourself, whether you repent you truly of
your former sins, stedfastly resolving to lead a new life. Whether you
have a lively faith in God's mercy through Christ, with a thankful
remembrance of his death, and are in perfect charity with all men. Is that,
sir, your state of mind at present?’</p>
<p>‘Those are the prevailing impressions of my 
<pb n="276"/>
mind at this moment,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘as nearly as I could myself
describe them. Will you now administer the sacrament to me, as I wish to
be left a little to my own reflections, or defer it till this time to-morrow?’</p>
<p>‘To-morrow, at this time, I will return again and administer the
sacrament, if you continue to desire it,’ said Mr. Austin, ‘till then,
therefore, I commend you to the grace of God, through Christ, and the
  teaching of his Holy Spirit.<note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a022">See Note Y.</xref></note>’</p>
<p>On the return of Mr. Austin, the following morning, ‘Sir,’ said Mr.
Cotton, after introducing him to Edward Bentinck, whom he had in the
mean time appointed to meet him, ‘the best evidence a convert like
myself can manifest of his sincerity (indeed, as it seems to me, an
indispensable evidence) is to endeavour, wherever he has done wrong,
and atonement is possible, but which alas!’ said he, sighing deeply,
‘'is but too seldom the case, to make four-fold reparation. I have long
known the affection subsisting between the two young persons before
you, and I have consented to their union; but it is upon one express
condition, of which, as I feel my strength rapidly declining, I wish to make
you the witness; it is merely this, that if it should please God to remove 
<pb n="277"/>
me, without permitting my return to my plantations, that they would endeavour
to make my slaves the only, but indeed an ample, compensation for any injustice
of which I may have been either directly or indirectly the author to them, by
instructing them systematically and steadily in that providential provision of
spiritual peace and mercy, which I now feel to be of more value to me than the
abundant wealth which I have derived from their exertions. That this may be
done, I am quite satisfied, not only with facility, but with the greatest advantage,
as well to the value of the property as the security of the colony; but then they
must be contented to reside, till Charles is of age, or for a few years at any rate,
upon the spot, and superintend the progress of the simple plan, which I will now
propose to them. Let there be two lists made immediately of the Christian and
Heathen slaves; let those negroes, in the instruction of whom Matilda, with the
help of her late excellent Moravian friend, (who is now, no doubt, enjoying the
crown of his fidelity,) has already made considerable progress, and every one of
whom would scarcely hesitate more to lay down his life for her than to obey her
lightest command, (and well they may almost adore her,) form the first list.</p>
<pb n="278"/>
<p>Let these always work together and apart from the others. And with these <hi rend="i">at once</hi>
and <hi rend="i">immediately</hi> let all whippings and violence, and ensigns of violence be
discontinued; if one of these perseveres in a fault after having been once
reproved for it, let the reproof be repeated in the presence of two or three of the
other Christian slaves, and if the fault is committed a third time, let him be
solemnly admonished of its guilt and consequences by the minister in the face of
the whole negro church, and if this does not restrain the offender, let him be
transferred back to the list of and company of the heathen negroes, who must
continue under the discipline of corporal punishment, till, by their improvement
in the knowledge of Christianity, they show themselves qualified for baptism,
and susceptible of moral controul and impulsion, when, after the ceremony of
baptism, which must be made as impressive as possible, they may be transferred
to the list and immunities of the Christian slaves, so that their promotion from
one list to another may be constantly operating as a stimulant to their good
behaviour. As an additional advantage to the Christian negroes, exact from their
wives as little field work as possible, so that every facility may be given to them
to make themselves, their children, and their little cabin houses attrac-
<pb n="279"/>
tive to their husbands, and 'the evening paradise of home,' the sacred
endearments of wedded love, and the indulgence of parental affection may afford
them, as it was meant they should, the best reward for the toil of the day: in
addition to this, let the present cost of each negro in food and clothing be divided
by the days of the year, and with a sufficient addition amply to cover any loss
resulting from the difference between a wholesale and retail expenditure, be
trusted to the most discreet and intelligent amongst them, to expend (like the
wages of a European peasant) for themselves, if they prefer it in lieu of receiving
their supply of food and clothing from their master; but this, like every other
privilege for several years, must be conditioned upon their good behaviour, and
revocable on its abuse.</p>
<p>‘By a perseverance in this simple scheme of moral discipline for only
a few years, I am quite satisfied that the negroes might be brought into
the habits of free labour, not only without loss, but with the greatest gain
to the interests of all parties, especially the owners of the soil, the only
thing to remain imperative upon them being an obligation to work for
<hi rend="i">somebody</hi> at a rate of wages to be fixed by the law, in reference to the
price of those things which are the actual necessaries of 
<pb n="280"/>
life to them, and not either by themselves or their masters. But as for their
unqualified emancipation in their present state, without any preparative course of
religious instruction, we may as well talk of making atonement to a kidnapped
infant by abandoning it in the midst of an ocean or a desert.’</p>
<p>‘I agree with you entirely,’ said Mr. Austin, ‘in the principles you
have expressed, the details of every plan for the elevation of large bodies
of men from a state of almost brutal darkness, must be modified by the
light which the experiment itself will produce in every stage of its
progress.’</p>
<p>‘They must,’ said Mr. Cotton, ‘and to the direction of that light I
must leave them, as I find I have not strength to pursue them farther. I
now, sir, earnestly desire you to administer to me the symbols, (if I still
scarcely dare say of God's <hi rend="i">pardon</hi> and <hi rend="i">mercy</hi>,) at least of that great
<hi rend="i">atonement</hi> in which I place my only <hi rend="i">hope</hi> of them.’</p>
<p>Mr. Austin then immediately proceeded to distribute the sacred
elements, (of which Mr. Bentinck and Matilda partook,) resting with
solemn emphasis on the word <hi rend="i">you</hi>, in the short prayer accompanying the
presentment of the bread and wine to each individual, and on the
completion of the service, Mr. Cotton kissed his daughter with great
affection, and taking Mr. Bentinck by the 
<pb n="281"/>
hand, said, ‘Yes! I believe it, Matilda! even for <hi rend="i">me</hi> the devotion of a new
life would be a poor return for such ill deserved, such unpurchased
forgiveness, and I feel that I have not many hours to live; but you must
both take upon you my debt of gratitude. Compose yourself, my dear
Matilda! we shall meet again.’</p>
<p>‘O papa!’ said Matilda, ‘how can I live without you, how can I
bear to think that you who knew no sacrifice, not even of your own
opinions, your own pride, too great for your affection to me, are really
about to leave me and be out of reach of my grateful attentions, and that
too when a community of principles would have made you more than by
nature's bond a parent, would have made you a spiritual father to me; I
thought I could have borne even this, if I could but see you a Christian,
but I find that I am still too, too selfish!’</p>
<p>‘Matilda!’ said Mr. Cotton, putting her hand into Mr. Bentinck's, ‘I
feel confident that the Christian soldier, in whose care I leave you, will
prove himself worthy of the great trust I repose in him, and be to you both
parent and friend; but for my sake endeavour to preserve the cheerful
confidence which has lately supported you through such severe trials,
and which I never saw 
<pb n="282"/>
fail you before, in the Almighty Parent, Friend, and Saviour of us all. And
remember, my darling, and let it mitigate your sorrow when I am gone, that you
have more than requited all my affection, that it was the sweet harmony of your
life with your principles that has been chiefly the human means of my
conviction, for I could not help sometimes reflecting, that principles so beautiful
in their effect must be divine in their origin; but I am a good deal exhausted by
this morning's exertion, and unequal to conversation.’</p>
<p>Mr. Bentinck having endeavoured in vain to prevail on Matilda to leave
the room, by a strong effort she completely renewed her self-controul,
and sat quietly by her father's bed without uttering a word or a sigh, till,
after lying for several hours in a sort of dose, from which she had
expected he would awake comparatively refreshed and animated, he
distinctly pronounced the words, ‘Matilda! your mother!’ -- she
stooped over him, a single tear was trickling down his cheeks, but she
saw immediately that his lips were settled into imperturbable placidity,
and would never move again. She could not speak, but kissed his
forehead, and seizing convulsively the hand of Edward Bentinck, laid her
head upon his shoulder, and at length relieved her long repressed and
un-
<pb n="283"/>
utterable agony by a burst of tears and sighs, that in such a moment it would
have been sacrilege to have interrupted or discouraged.</p>
<p>It only remains with me to acquaint my reader that our hero, in spite of
the <hi rend="i">glory-panting</hi> (to use a military expression) with which he entered the
service, <hi rend="i">some how or another</hi>, when it came to the point, found little
difficulty in exchanging his ensign's commission for a fortune of a
hundred thousand pounds sterling. That after a proper interval he was
united in lawful wedlock to our sweet heroine, with whom he has since
been conscientiously employed in carrying into execution Mr. Cotton's
directions for the Christian instruction and civilization of his negroes, and
what is more, employed with <hi rend="i">complete success</hi>; but there is a secret in
the success of this plan (and it is the <hi rend="i">only secret</hi>) which I will now, at the
earnest request of His Grace of Devonshire, Earl Fitzwilliam, and a few
more of the great Irish planters, disclose. The secret consists in the
constant <hi rend="i">presence</hi> and superintendance - watching, correcting, and
controlling every disposition to the perversion of the sacred knowledge -
of those who are most interested in its success. O yes! I forgot! there are
two things more which the reader will perhaps like to be informed of,
namely, that Captain 
<pb n="284"/>
Légere was tried, convicted, and imprisoned, but afterwards, I am sorry to say,
  by connivance either of the fiscal or some of his police officers, <note n="*" place="foot"><xref to="a023">See Note Z.</xref></note> escaped;
and that Mr. William Askens, being a British subject, was sent for trial to
Barbadoes, where, <hi rend="i">no doubt</hi>, he was made a proper example of, as it was so
highly important that he should, by the crown officers of those very high
principled and pious claimants of all the Christian and philanthropic honours of
the British name and character.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Having</hi> now concluded my friend's manuscript, I cannot forbear availing
myself of the opportunity of offering a few observations <hi rend="i">meo marte</hi> on the
subject which probably suggested and forms so much of the ground work
of the foregoing little fiction, (fiction at least as far as <hi rend="i">names</hi> <hi rend="i">of persons</hi>
go, but fact in many particulars, and of too possible reality in all,) viz. the
system of slavery as it prevails at present in the Dutch Colony of
Surinam, where I have now had several years opportunity of personal
observation, but never having resided in any other part of the West
Indies, however applicable the general principle of my observations may
be, my testimony must of 
<pb n="286"/>
course be understood to be confined to Surinam alone.</p>
<p>The courteous reader, who has done me the honour to begin at the
<hi rend="i">beginning</hi> of the preceding tale, may perhaps think it hard not to be
permitted to leave off at the <hi rend="i">end</hi>; but I will not detain him long with my
editorial supplement, indeed I have but little to say, and before I say that
little, I have a postulatum to make, without which I have <hi rend="i">nothing at all</hi>; for,
without that, I confess myself absolutely at sea, without either chart or
compass, or a single star by which I can discern with confidence in so
complex and far-spreading a subject any certain course of moral duty. My
postulatum is the <hi rend="sc">truth of Christianity</hi>, and if it is <hi rend="i">not</hi> true, it is an
imposture of more subtle and refined cruelty than could have been the
invention of any but fiends; for would it not be cruel in a parent to
entangle the young conscience of his children in fetters so
comprehensive, and impose upon it a standard of self-constraint and self-sacrifice so all-pervasive and unrelaxing, that an unreserved, implicit, and
<hi rend="i">unsubterfugitive</hi> conformity to it, must, whilst real Christians continue the
minority of mankind, involve him in a life of lingering martyrdom, or a
deliberately <hi rend="i">partial, cheat-devil</hi>, and <hi rend="i">mental-reser</hi>-
<pb n="287"/>
<hi rend="i">vation</hi> conformity, in a misgiving of heart (if he is not a monster without
one) of which truly the aptest possible figure is that of a worm which
never dies; - and this hell or martyrdom so realized upon the conscience
and life of the most generous and susceptible-hearted, to be, after all, (as
infidels say,) only the fiction of beldames and priests! Fiction of <hi rend="sc">fiends</hi>, <hi rend="i">I</hi>
say, if <hi rend="i">fiction</hi> it is - but fiends are a bug-bear, if Christianity is false, - they
form an essential part of Revelation - and if Christianity is true, then
courteous reader, I boldly charge the system of slavery which now
prevails in Surinam with being utterly incompatible with the inculcation of
its doctrines and duties upon the slaves. Of this I need only here give one
proof, but it is conclusive; the slaves in Surinam are <hi rend="sc">forbidden to
marry</hi>. There is a penalty of five hundred guilders actually imposed by
the Court of Policy upon any religious minister who performs the
  ceremony of marriage between slaves.<note n="*" place="foot"> I was unable to obtain permission to marry one of my own
    domestics, a freeman, to a slave, (whom I offered to buy for that purpose,
    and let her work out her freedom,) because she was a slave. -
    <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</note> If Christianity be true, can
any government offer it a greater outrage? To say that marriage is the
hinge upon which all the 
<pb n="288"/>
charities of this life turn is undeniably true, but not the whole truth; it is
<hi rend="i">more</hi>, it is the only link which connects the charities of time with those of
eternity. It is from the religious recognition of this sacred contract that
those charities derive all their sanctimony, all their refinement, all their
civilizing effect, all their social value. That marriage is a <hi rend="i">civil</hi> contract is
perfectly true, as all contracts must be between members of <hi rend="i">civil</hi> society;
but that it is a civil contract in contradistinction to its being a religious one,
is <hi rend="i">not</hi> true; for, not only does our Saviour expressly recognize it as a
contract of divine obligation, but refers to the very words of its institution
  by God<note n="*" place="foot"><name type="bible">Genesis, ii. 24.</name></note> in the original creation of man, as the great rudimental
moral principle of human society. Indeed, it must be obvious to every one
accustomed to trace the operation of moral institutions upon moral
principles, that all communities must advance in civilization in proportion
to the inviolability with which they maintain the sanctity of this institution,
or retrograde towards barbarism, as it is disregarded. Now, if Christianity
is of God, it cannot be overthrown; but, on the contrary, all communities
which systematically defy or oppose it must be themselves overthrown
with a confusion and vio-
<pb n="289"/>
lence and ruin to individuals, exactly proportioned to the obstinacy and
daringness with which they have resisted its light and contemned its authority.</p>
<p>Besides the <hi rend="i">formal legal</hi> <hi rend="sc">desecration</hi> of marriage by the government of
Surinam, there is the greatest possible jealousy of the instruction of the slaves in
any language but their own jargon, which is so scanty as not to contain perhaps
above five hundred words, and must, <hi rend="i">I think</hi>, be quite an inadequate vehicle to
convey any comprehensive impression in all its foundation, parts, and purposes,
  of the sublime spiritual temple of christianity.<note n="*" place="foot"> I must confess here, however, that the Moravians think that they <hi rend="i">can</hi>
    and do make the negroes understand Christianity with it; all I can say is, that if
    they do, it is no mean evidence that the great truths of christianity must find in
    every human heart some essential principles of homogeneal sympathy and ready
    recognition; for they certainly will not admit of definite explanation in the negro
    language at Surinam without the frequent introduction of English, Dutch, or
    German terms and idioms, the comprehension of which by the negroes can only
    be explained on such a principle. But however this be, let me here pay my
    humble tribute of respect to the conduct of these amiable missionaries, as far as I
    have been able to observe it, whatever extravagances mixed themselves in the
    speculations of their founder, they are now actually doing more good, if their
    conduct is elsewhere as unexceptionable as it is at Surinam, than any
    missionaries with whose labours I am acquainted, except those at Serampore
    (whose whole lives have been little short of apostolic devotion); and the Moravians seem to
    me to be following their illustrious example (illustrious, I mean, to angels and
    the spirits of just men made like angels) as closely as possible. Mild, humble,
    inobtrusive, judicious, earning their own bread by some useful social calling,
    that their ministerial labours may not <hi rend="i">absolutely</hi> depend upon any thing so
    capricious as popular support; instant, in season and out of season, to employ
    any opportunities that occur of Christian usefulness, but <hi rend="i">asking</hi> for nothing; in
    great esteem with the governor himself, and indeed all persons of the least
    pretensions to respectability. I have even heard one of the most notorious Deists
    and slave traders in the colony candidly admit the moral improvement of the
    negroes under their charge; and adduce a servant of his own, in whose honesty
    he had the most absolute confidence, as an example. I commend them to the
    munificence of the British Christian public. If any persons can infuse a ray, a
    leaven of christianity, (under the present system,) into the mass of midnight
    pagan darkness in which the slaves of Surinam are enveloped, it is they only; but
    their means, I fear, are much too scanty.</note></p>

<pb n="290"/>
<p>But (barring the truth of christianity for a single moment) there is but one
possible ground that I know of by which the <hi rend="sc">system</hi> of slavery at present
existing in Surinam can be vindicated, viz. that the Africans are, if not an
inferior species of rational animal, an inferior variety of the same species.
Christianity, however, knows but of <hi rend="sc">one</hi> species without any <hi rend="i">natural</hi> variety;
<hi rend="i">but I</hi> positively deny the fact of <hi rend="i">essential</hi> inferiority, either specific or various, or
that any one has a right to 
<pb n="291"/>
assume it till the same moral apparatus of Christian education has been applied
to the Africans from their childhood, as that which is employed in Europe. It has
sometimes, indeed, been boldly said by the advocates of their oppression, that
nothing but essential inferiority would account for their long submission to the
irresponsible sway of the pride, caprice, spleen, lust, and avarice of a handful of
Europeans, and those often the scum and refuse of their own countries; as there
are no ties of blood, country, or community of national associations or religious
faith to explain it, as there are in Russia and other <hi rend="sc">national despotisms</hi>;
and I grant, if it were true, that they so submitted to a handful of whites the
reproach of their own country and their country's faith, it would carry a strong
presumption of some great inherent inferiority. But, courteous Reader, here
again <hi rend="i">I</hi> positively deny the fact. The negroes in the West Indies do <hi rend="i">not</hi> submit to
a handful of whites; they know perfectly that any violent attempt at escape from
the controul of their immediate masters would bring down upon them all the
power and vengeance of the country to which those masters belong. They submit
(at least the British negroes) to <hi rend="sc">you</hi>, most courteous British Readers, and you
are laying a flattering unction to your soul indeed, if you think 
<pb n="292"/>
to transfer <hi rend="i">all</hi> the guilt of their oppression to their <hi rend="i">immediate</hi> masters. Had these
gentlemen, at the commencement of the series of measures now in progress for
the amelioration of the condition of the British negroes argued in this way - Do
not make us the scape goats of the national sins, you are all <hi rend="i">participes criminis</hi>.
We admit the evil of slavery in all its civil and religious magnitude, but we are
not the authors of it; many of us are involved in it against our will, having
derived our West Indian property from parents and grand parents, and having,
many of us, families wholly dependent on it for their maintenance. We equally
with you deplore its evils, and will lend ourselves gladly, cheerfully, and <hi rend="sc">bona-fide</hi> to any experiments that his Majesty's ministers shall recommend for the
removal of such evils, provided always that, in case any loss, or ultimate and
permanent depreciation of our private property occurs from those experiments,
the losers shall be entitled to full compensation, except where it can be proved
that such loss or depreciation occurred from any obstinate obstruction offered by
the losers themselves to the success of those experiments, and also except where
the present holder has purchased his property since the period when the character
of West Indian slavery first came into 
<pb n="293"/>
serious agitation in the British Parliament, as such holders (by their own
clamorous and eternal asseverations) purchased their properties at a price
proportionably reduced by the constant fear and uncertainty they were kept in of
farther parliamentary interference.</p>
<p>Had the <hi rend="sc">Old</hi> British planters, I say, argued in this way at the
commencement of the experiments now in progress, I do not see well
how the justice of their argument and the <hi rend="i">contingent</hi> claims founded upon
it, could have been either denied or resisted. Philanthropy at another's
expense is very cheap benevolence, and unworthy of either a Briton or a
Christian; whether by the argument and conduct they <hi rend="i">have</hi> adopted, they
have not now completely shut themselves out from all such claims upon
their countrymen, I leave to that illustrious senate which represents the
national character, and takes charge of the national interests, to
determine; but surely the nation need not be afraid of conceding to the
old West Indians such <hi rend="i">contingent</hi> claims, as it is clear that the success of
all experiments conducted by the government must depend very much
  upon the government itself.<note n="*" place="foot"> It would be ridiculous to suppose that the voice of an individual,
    the humility of whose circumstances is such as to confine him to an exile
    so pernicious and noisome (both morally and physically speaking) as mine,
    should ever reach the ears, or (at least) arrest the attention of his Majesty's
    ministers; but if it could, I would say, <hi rend="sc">be firm</hi>, and you will at once
    <hi rend="sc">christianize</hi> and <hi rend="sc">save</hi> the West Indies. <hi rend="sc">Be vacillating</hi>, and you will
    at once <hi rend="sc">barbarize</hi> and ruin them. - <hi rend="i">Editor</hi>. </note> And consider, most cour-
<pb n="294"/>
teous Reader, if you are <hi rend="i">really</hi> afraid of the <hi rend="i">possible</hi> amount of such
<hi rend="i">contingent</hi> claims upon your unparalleled national affluence and
inexhaustible resources, how it strengthens the argument of the old
slave-holders, and weakens your claims to the credit of <hi rend="i">disinterested</hi>
benevolence; but if you would only submit for a few years to an <hi rend="i">express
tax for doubling all your West Indian garrisons merely during the
substitution of legal and moral, for physical impulsion to labour</hi>, I am quite
satisfied you might <hi rend="i">safely</hi> undertake the <hi rend="i">contingent</hi> indemnity I have
mentioned; partial tumults, indeed, and casual destruction of property,
might still occur, but its amount in a national point of view must, I am
persuaded, be trifling. I cannot help, therefore, expressing my most
humble but earnest hope that nothing will deter the christian part of the
British public, which I trust is becoming, (how can I help wishing so, if
christianity is true?) and will daily more and more become the influential
part upon the British councils, from persevering in their glorious cause;
difficulties will vanish as their determination becomes <hi rend="i">definite and
immoveable</hi>.</p>
<pb n="295"/>
<p>Whilst the British government exacts of their subjects in their individual
capacity a submission to their restraints, and punishes them for impugning the
divine authority of Christianity, the public have a right to call upon the ministers,
in common decency, to defer in their official capacity to the obligations that
<hi rend="i">Christianity</hi> imposes upon them as the representatives, stewards, and
depositaries of the wealth, power, and talents of a Christian country, and that
country unrivalled in wealth, power, and talents by any in the world; and - let the
friends of rational liberty remember, that if they do not support Christianity,
Christianity cannot support them. The progress of Christianity is quite as
indispensable to the progress of rational liberty, as the progress of the latter is to
that of the former. Liberty unaccompanied by some strong moral principles of
self-restraint (and if the truth of Christianity is surrendered, I know not whence
they are to be efficiently derived,) is sure to degenerate into licentiousness and
anarchy, and thence to take shelter under despotism, from the outrages which a
vicious people would otherwise be continually committing upon each other. On
the other hand, the progress of rational liberty is equally indispensable to the
safe diffusion of the truths of Christianity, which might otherwise be 
<pb n="296"/>
abused by a few crafty hypocrites into a source of bigotry, papacy, inquisitions,
and the most abject mental thraldom, - a perversion of the glorious liberty with
which true religion makes men free, into outer darkness, and a bondage worse
than Egyptian, which was merely of the body. At the same time, let it not
however be forgotten, that with regard to the diffusion of Protestant Christianity,
the province of temporal government is merely to <hi rend="i">afford facilities</hi> and <hi rend="i">remove
obstructions</hi>. It is a very objectionable thing on every ground, both of religion
and liberty, to invite the legislature to give the law an inquisitorial character, by
making them too busy with private vices. Let it not be overlooked, that there are
portions of Christian discipline that can only be safely administered by
individuals to themselves; for I would humbly submit, that there are sins of
which (however much opposed to sanctification) the violent controul (where
their practice involves no violence to individual will or family security) would
infallibly drive numbers either into Bedlam, or into total abandonment of
themselves to infidelity or Antinomianism. Acts of Parliament, for example, for
bringing execrations and ribaldry off officers and seamen, and, indeed, many
acts of personal immorality to courts-martial on board a ship, <hi rend="i">never have</hi> 
<pb n="297"/>
or <hi rend="i">can</hi> be enforced; nor could any similar human law be impartially executed in
regiments, colleges, inns of court, or any body of men of whom <hi rend="i">I</hi> have any
experience. Now and then private malice may pounce upon a victim, but the
mischief done in such cases by the encouragement afforded to the indulgence of
resentment and sycophancy in the informer, and the impression made of
partiality in the administration of the laws, is, in my humble opinion, more than
equivalent to the benefit of the example in the way of determent. What justice of
the peace could impartially levy the fine at present imposed by act of parliament
for profane swearing? His equals and neighbours would be afraid of his doors,
lest a careless expletive should expose them to a penalty. The amenities of
private social intercourse would be destroyed by the rigid and impartial
execution of such laws, and <hi rend="i">I</hi>, for one, can never agree to the legal <hi rend="i">enforcement</hi>
of any moral restraints upon the poor that are not equally enforced upon the rich.
Far, far from me, be such a reflection upon the noblest portion of the British
people - noblest, I mean, in the leading features of their professional character -
most alive to generous impulses, least actuated by mercenary motives, most
disdainful of deliberate guile, and ever most alive to show ‘their 
<pb n="298"/>
manly bosoms to the fiercest foe’ - the navy - as to suppose that a ship's
crew is not to be brought into <hi rend="i">some degree</hi> of Christian consistency in
their individual comportment; but it must be done by regular, painful, and
persevering ministerial instruction, and the cheerful example of the
cornmanding officers in deferring to those instructions themselves, but
<hi rend="i">not</hi> by <hi rend="i">courts-martial</hi>. The same argument applies in part to the
Christianisation of negroes; it would be much better that they should
receive their religious improvement from the instruction and example of
their masters, if they would afford it to them; but I am compelled to
declare, from my knowledge of the resident whites in Surinam, Dutch,
Scotch, and English, that this is quite a preposterous expectation. If,
therefore, the Dutch or British Governments wish at length to deprecate a
vengeance from heaven like that which is now desolating Spain, by deep
though late repentance for the centuries during which (<hi rend="i">upon the
postulatum of Christianity being true</hi>) they have in their West Indian
policy defied it, they <hi rend="i">must</hi> take the Christian instruction of their negroes
entirely out of the hands of their <hi rend="i">soi-disant</hi> owners. If it is urged that this
will diminish the respect of the slave for his owner, I answer, no matter, if
it is <hi rend="i">proportionably increased</hi> for those 
<pb n="299"/>
who form the <hi rend="sc">appeal authorities</hi> of both parties, viz. <hi rend="sc">the
governments of the mother countries</hi>. It is upon the confidence
of the negroes in the sincerity, truth, good faith, and parental protection and
redress for grievous injustice of these <hi rend="sc">appeal powers</hi>, that the quiescence
and forbearance of self-redress in the negroes <hi rend="i">must</hi> very much depend; for I am
quite satisfied, courteous reader, that negroes are men, and to be governed upon
the same general principles as any other men, and susceptible of the same moral
influence. The difference in either respect, if any, is one merely of <hi rend="i">modification</hi>.
That a long course of misrule and abominations can be reformed without <hi rend="i">some</hi>
danger, I dare not assert; but that the danger would be greatly diminished, if not
entirely removed, by the uniformity and steadiness which a scheme of West
Indian evangelisation could only derive from Government's undertaking it, I
contend strenuously. By <hi rend="i">danger</hi> I mean, of course, danger to the white
proprietors; for danger, as far as the interests of the negroes are concerned, is
utterly inapplicable to <hi rend="i">any</hi> mode of introducing Christianity amongst them, (if
Christianity is true,) whether by individuals or the Government; and even to the
whites, although danger must attend the <hi rend="i">partial</hi> and <hi rend="i">irregular</hi> diffusion of new
light 
<pb n="300"/>
into the negro mind according to the temper on which it acts, if there are no
Government provisions made for its free circulation and safe conduct; yet I do
believe that even its partial influence <hi rend="i">may</hi> also operate as their security, and that
it <hi rend="i">did</hi> do so essentially in Demarara I am convinced.</p>
<p>The real enemies of the West Indians, I confess, have always appeared
to me to be such persons as the writers who profess to defend them in
Blackwood and John Bull, who deceive and tamper with them, and make
them believe that the people of England sit so loosely by their affection to
Christianity, that their late calls upon their Government for the distinct
recognition of its authority in all parts of their empire, if they mean to
maintain its authority at home, is a mere passing extravagance of
enthusiasm or fanatical caprice; so that instead of setting themselves
heartily and at once to assimilate their properties, and, by so doing, the
security of their tenures, to those of the mother country, by the delay, and
partiality, and inefficiency of their co-operation, (to say the least,) if not by
direct opposition, they have often certainly betrayed a design of baffling
the best wishes of their Christian countrymen; and every step that has
been won by the mother country in the sub-
<pb n="301"/>
duction of West Indian atrocity has been won in the teeth and defiance of
almost every difficulty which the West Indians could safely object to it,
either in argument or practice. Either these writers are really covert
infidels, or they know nothing at all about the state of slavery in Dutch
Guiana, where the proprietors have the power, and <hi rend="i">generally</hi>, as far as I
can learn, exercise it, of forbidding either the baptism or the marriage of
their negroes. Upon the latter observance between slaves, indeed, as I
have before said, there is an actual penalty upon the minister performing
the ceremony. The present system of slavery, therefore, which prevails at
Surinam, I again assert to be utterly incompatible with the inculcation of
the doctrines and duties of Christianity upon the mass of the population
involved in it; and if, therefore, Christianity is true, must be overborne by
that irresistible will which has decreed its progress, and to which all
opposition must recoil upon its authors, or must be superseded by one
adapted to facilitate, and not obstruct, the march of divine knowledge.</p>
<p>Pardon, gentle Christian reader, the desultoriness of these few
observations. A climate within six degrees of the equator, of which four-fifths of the soil is an absolute swamp below the level of the sea, and
which has never allowed me six con-
<pb n="302"/>
secutive hours of health since I first arrived in it, will, I trust, disarm any very
severe criticism on the composition of either this little editorial epilogue or the
narrative to which it is subjoined; and which I would not have presumed to
address to you, but the chances are many against my surviving my engagements
in this colony, and I could not forego the opportunity of earnestly invoking you
not to relax in the noble contest in which you have already won such decisive
advantages. In a cause like this, remember, Government derive all their strength
from the voice of the public, and however earnest their own individual wishes
may be for the extension of the practical influences of Christianity, (from which
alone, if Christianity be true, any reasonable hopes can be entertained of material
improvement in the proportions of human happiness and misery,) cannot go in
their legislative character, at least with the slightest good effect, beyond the
public feeling. In despotisms, indeed, the public feeling is led by the
Government; but in countries where the spirit of liberty so pervades all her
institutions as in England, the converse of this must in a great measure be true;
and what is the measure of good which the world may not hope to derive from
the perfect concert of the popular and executive energies of <hi rend="sc">England</hi>, when 
<pb n="303"/>
perseveringly employed in subserving the bounties of heaven, and propagating
the only means vouchsafed or encouraged by God for improving the condition of

<p>See the reports of all the naval officers employed on the service of suppressing
the slave trade, printed in the papers laid before Parliament on that subject. From
their peculiarly unexceptionable authority they should be collected and
published in a separate pamphlet; of the <hi rend="sc">character</hi> of this <hi rend="sc">hell-engendered</hi> trade, and its only efficient European ally and champion the
<hi rend="sc">French Bourbon government</hi>, which deliberately and systematically
baffles all the best energies and prodigal expenses of the British people to
overcome it, they are <hi rend="sc">decisive</hi>. It would swell this little essay too much to
introduce them here, but there is one anecdote recorded by the late Sir George
Collier so honourable to the character of British seamen, and so worthy to
illuminate the page of any national history, that I am sure my readers will thank
me for extracting it.</p>
<p>Extract from the Second Annual Report of Capt. Sir G. R. Collier, upon the
settlements on the coast of Africa, dated 16th September, 1820, addressed to J.
W. Croker, Esq. and printed in the ‘Further Papers relating to the
Suppression 
<pb n="306"/>
of the Slave Trade,’ laid before the House of Commons, April, 1821.</p>
<p>‘In order to examine more minutely the various rivers emptying
themselves on the windward coast, a fast-sailing vessel was procured at
the joint expense of myself and some of the officers, for the purpose of
affording a covering to the crews of the several boats employed in the
service, where frigates and sloops of war could not approach, thus
protecting them as well from the effects of sun and tornadoes, as from
the injurious consequences of the night dews and common rains, the
Tartar, (Sir G. Collier's flag ship,) keeping under sail in the offing, and in
sight of signal. This arrangement, so far as the health of the officers and
ship's company was concerned, proved a most material benefit, and
though the vessel was purposely unarmed to avoid the chance of any
deviation from my instructions, yet her utility in the object I had in view
was so pre-eminently conspicuous, that the officers likely to be
occasionally employed in boats, <hi rend="i">requested to be allowed to take a
proportion of the expense</hi>. Had there been a chance of any pecuniary
emolument arising from this measure, as in time of actual war, I should
not have felt it necessary to notice this circumstance; but the desire
springing from the best feelings of the heart, and which had been roused
in this instance into an active benevolence by the dreadful scenes
occasionally witnessed in the suffering misery of the unfortunate captives
from the African shores, I have felt it due to the character of my officers to
show, that the same philanthropic feelings which actuate the conduct of
so large a proportion of our countrymen are not confined to those
resident on shore. Indeed, were it necessary, I could prove that on some
occasions, where I have had doubts as to 
<pb n="307"/>
further detention of slaving ships, from the chance of incurring heavy damages,
and perhaps entire loss of fortune, and whilst the slaving vessels have been
under examination by myself and officers, <hi rend="sc">the whole crew</hi> <hi rend="i">of the Tartar
have come forward, and in the most decorous but urgent manner, have added
their entreaties to the measure, offering their growing pay as a security for their
proportion of the expense, in case of the non-condemnation of the vessel by the
mixed court at Sierra Leone; though it was explained to and fully understood by
them, that as the law now stood, no pecuniary benefit could arise to any one
from head-money as formerly, even though the condemnation should actually
take place. It therefore strongly proves what the misery and sufferings of the
slave must be, until he may reach his point of destination, when they could
produce such strong effects upon so many unlettered and uneducated minds as
the crew of a man of war may be supposed to be composed of</hi>.</p>
<p>‘On this distressing subject,’ Sir George concludes his report,
‘so revolting to every well-regulated mind, I will add, that such is the
merciless treatment of the slaves by the persons engaged in the traffic,
that no fancy can picture the horror of the voyage, <hi rend="i">crowded together so
as not to give the power to move, linked one to the other by the leg,
never unfettered while life remains, or till the iron shall have fretted the
flesh to the bone, forced under a deck, as I have seen them, not thirty
inches in height, breathing an atmosphere the most putrid and pestilential
possible, with little food and</hi> <hi rend="sc">less water</hi>, <hi rend="i">subject also to the most
severe punishment at the caprice or fancy of the brute who may
command the vessel. It is to me a matter of extreme wonder, that any of
these miserable people live the voyage through; many of them, indeed,
perish on the passage, and those who remain to meet the shore, present
  a picture of wretchedness language cannot express</hi>.’</p>

diminish if they did not live under the ægis of a civilized government, and
nothing prevents the indefinite increase of their happiness and numbers but their
abandonment by their unnatural lords, and their most calamitous religion.
Always sowing tares amongst wheat to make their destruction impossible, and
grafting perversion upon truth, how plainly is that religion a contrivance of the
great enemy of man and Christ; - and the malignity of its influence upon man's
best interests, wherever it prevails, is truly worthy of the guile of its dark

<p>It is not in one or two but in all points that Christianity collides with the
Surinam system of negro slavery, and Satan might as easily have
dispersed the palpable obscure of his daring flight through chaos with a
single torch, as a few Christian missionaries, by their unaided efforts,
pierce with a single ray of pure and properly comprehended Christianity
the midnight paganism of the negro mind there, which it has been the
guilty policy of the Colonial Government for centuries to perpetuate by
every regulation in their power. The missionaries may and must sacrifice
themselves if they are good men; and they may drive the negroes upon
whom they make any valuable religious impression to revolt or suicide, as
the life of an intelligent, thoroughly taught Christian slave, subject to the
capricious and uncontrollable despotism of such a dreg of his colour as
Mr. Hogshead, or even an infidel planter, to be insulted and taunted
before the heathen slaves, to be spited upon every occasion, punished
for the most trifling offences, overworked, underfed, under-clothed,
under-medicined, every bad habit <hi rend="i">subdued</hi> of drinking, swearing,
stealing, or sexual vagrancy, overlooked or derided, every faulty habit
remaining <hi rend="i">unsubdued</hi>, called proof of hypocrisy, and doubly punished,
must be <hi rend="sc">hell - hell</hi>. But a revolution (humanely speaking) to clear

    those incapable of modification. How can any adequate idea of Christianity be

<p>It was my misfortune for six months of my life, in the years eighteen hundred
and twenty-four and five, to live next door in Paramaribo to a Dutch lawyer of
the name of Van Ess, a young man of about twenty-five years of age, who had
two girls and a mulatto lad from eighteen to twenty years of age in his service,
upon whom altogether, but chiefly the girls, he bestowed during the six months
no less than <hi rend="i">fourteen</hi> floggings, of which this was the manner; the girls wrists are
tied together and their naked bodies to a post, (a single linen apron only, about
the size and substance of a large pocket handkerchief being tied round their
waists,) whilst a strong male slave belabours them with a long whip till the
master tells him to desist, who sometimes seems to act a sort of personification
of cruelty, by regulating the punishment by the number of pipes he smokes
during its infliction, as if for the purpose of vaunting the utter callousness and
insensibility of his national character to every sentiment of refinement, religion,
or humanity. I do not know what was the occasion of these punishments, if
necessary however, what becomes of the <hi rend="sc">system</hi> which could make them so?
If not, of the <hi rend="sc">brute</hi> which could, without necessity, employ them? The reader,
who has never lived in a community where Christianity is <hi rend="i">generally</hi> abjured, as it
is in Surinam, cannot conceive the rapid gravitation of 
<pb n="314"/>
humane nature towards brutality the moment its restraints are withdrawn,
because in England all its great sanctions are so interwoven into the frame of the
social polity, and the tone of public opinion is so established in its favour, that
those who most affect to deride its authority, cannot systematically at least
outrage its principles in their conduct, with impunity to their characters; but in
such places as Surinam, I verily believe the white settlers are only upheld from
sinking in the scale of brutalization and barbarity below the surrounding
savages, by the distant and feeble reflection of shame to which their mercantile
  connections still expose them from the voice of public opinion in Europe.</p>

<p>The cause is evident, they are just as full of degenerating passions, and as

character indications as unequivocal of moral ruin as the Europeans, but <hi rend="i">not

<p>In the case of the Demerara riots, it was proved that the truly Christian
insurgents had determined, in one or two of their preceding conferences, ‘<hi rend="i">not
to take life as they could not give it</hi>,’ and to shed no blood, as it was
contrary to the faith which they had been taught, in fact, it is clear this ill-requited scrupulousness lost them their end. I say <hi rend="i">ill-requited</hi>, for their
<hi rend="i">Christian</hi> masters, in the progress and sequel of this <hi rend="i">rebellion</hi>, contrived
to destroy (I think I have read) nearly <hi rend="sc">one thousand</hi> of them, but say
only <hi rend="sc">several hundreds</hi>: - who that ever lived in any unreformed part
of the West Indies, disconnected from the pagan and anti-christian
<hi rend="sc">system</hi> of society that prevails there, can wonder in his heart at the
celebrated toast of the great moralist, Dr. Johnson, ‘Success to the first
insurrection of Negroes in the West Indies.’ He saw that the whole
system from beginning to end was so atrocious, that it could never be 
<pb n="316"/>
reconciled to Christianity, or he would not have committed himself to so strong
an expression of his disapprobation of it. And as far as my experience goes, he
saw accurately. What says Alexander McDonnell, Esq. writing in defence of a
British Colony?</p>
<p>‘I think it will be generally allowed, that if slavery exist at all, there must be a very great discretionary power intrusted to those who have the superintendence of the properties. It is perfectly idle to attempt to regulate the conduct of those persons in all their minute duties. Power so extensive in its very nature as theirs, must necessarily exist beyond <hi rend="i">the controul of any law. It is no exaggeration whatever to say, that the happiness or misery of</hi></p>
<p>‘<hi rend="i">a slave is in a manager's keeping. If he takes any dislike or pique to any individual, he can harass the poor creature incessantly in a thousand different shapes</hi>.’ - Vide Considerations on Negro Slavery, by Alexander McDonnell, Esq. p. 281.</p>

<p>See the account of the death of a Monk of la Trappe, under a surgical
operation of excruciating pain, during the progress of which he never
uttered a groan, as being contrary to the rules of his order; but when,
upon the representation of the surgeon, that the operation must be fatal if
he persisted in such violence to nature, as to suppress every expression
of pain, the abbot told him to express what he felt, as he would dispense
with his vow of silence, the good monk used some such expressions as
  the above, and instantly expired.</p>

<p>I was in Surinam during all the period comprised in the above narration,
and none of the occurrences therein described took place, except the fire
of the town and shipping, and the execution of the Dutch soldier, which
events did really happen, but not cotemporaneously. The two preceding
chapters must therefore in all other respects be entirely fictitious. The
disgraceful trial and condemnation of a Christian missionary by a court-martial in an adjacent colony, is of posterior notoriety. Upon this subject. I
would submit for the opinion of his Majesty's Attorney-General, and all
others whom it may concern, the following question:</p>
<p>A, B, C, D, E , F, form an unlawful court, receive unlawful evidence, and
in violation even of that evidence, such as it is, convict, sentence to
death, and <hi rend="i">execute</hi> G, H. for practices not only not condemned but most
emphatically enjoined by Christianity. Query, do not A, B, C, D, E, F,
subject themselves by the laws of Great Britain, of which Christianity is
now distinctly recognised as a part, to indictment for the wilful murder of
G, H, i.e. to a conspiracy to take away his life with malice prepense?</p>
<p>I submit another question in the present day of very considerable and
growing importance to the administrators of British laws in the West
Indies.</p>
<p>J, K, a kidnapped African, in slavery in Demerara, runs away, and in
resisting a violent attempt to recapture him kills his assailant. Query,
could an indictment for murder be legally maintained in such a case
against J, K, or a British jury <hi rend="i">legally</hi> find any other verdict against him
than <hi rend="i">justifiable homicide</hi>; or if they did, could a judge without himself in-
<pb n="318"/>
curring the most serious penalty proceed to <hi rend="i">execute</hi> on a verdict of murder?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the same gentleman who was afterwards the government
chaplain of Demarara, and who in spite of the hornet's nest of infidels and
atheists which he must have known that he should, and in fact did, bring about
him, to the honour of the church of England, had the courage and Christian
integrity in the case of Mr. Smith to express himself as follows:</p>
<p>‘I feel no hesitation in declaring, from the intimate knowledge which
my most anxious inquiries have obtained, that in the late scourge which
the hand of an all-wise Creator has inflicted on this ill-fated country,
nothing but those religious impressions which, under Providence, Mr.
Smith has been instrumental in fixing - nothing but those principles of the
Gospel of Peace, which he has been proclaiming, could have prevented
a dreadful effusion of blood here, and saved the lives of those very
persons who are now (I shudder to write it) seeking his life.’</p>
<p>I cannot help adding, as it does him equal honour, the testimony of Mr.
Arrindall, Mr. Smith's counsel, to the same effect.</p>
<p>‘It is almost presumptuous in me to differ from the sentence of a
court, but, before God, I do believe Mr. Smith to be innocent, nay, I will
go further, and defy any minister of any sect whatever to have shown a
more faithful attention to his sacred duties than he has been proved, by
  the evidence on his trial, to have done.’</p>

<p>See this argument eloquently urged by the late Lord Erskine, in his defence of
the publisher of Paine's Age of Reason.</p>
<p>« But,’ said that highly gifted advocate, ‘it seems this is an age of
reason, and the time and the person are at length arrived, that are to
dissipate the errors which have overspread the past generations of
ignorance. The believers in Christianity are many; but it belongs to the
few that are wise to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of reason, and
superior reason may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In running the mind
along the long list of sincere and devout Christians, I cannot help
lamenting that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had his
shallowness filled up with this new flood of light. But the subject is too
awful for irony. I will speak plainly and directly. Newton was a Christian.
Newton, whose mind burst forth from the fetters fastened by nature upon
our finite conceptions - Newton, whose science was truth, and the
foundation of whose knowledge of it was philosophy; not those visionary
and arrogant presumptions which too often usurp its name, but
philosophy resting upon the basis of mathematics, which, like figures,
cannot lie - Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermost
barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which all created
matter exists and is held together. But this extraordinary man, in the
mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors which a minuter
investigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him.
What shall, then, be said of the great Mr. Boyle, who looked into the
organic structure of all matter, even to the 
<pb n="320"/>
inanimate substances which the foot treads upon? Such a man may be supposed
to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to
nature's God. Yet the result of all his contemplations was the most confirmed
and devout belief in all which the other holds in contempt, as despicable and
drivelling superstition. But this error might, perhaps, arise from a want of due
attention to the foundations of human judgment, and the structure of that
understanding which God has given us for the investigation of truth. Let that
question be answered by Mr. Locke, who, to the highest pitch of devotion and
adoration, was a Christian - Mr. Locke, whose office it was to detect the errors
of thinking, by going up to the very fountains of thought, and to direct into the
proper track of reasoning the devious mind of man, by showing him its whole
process, from the first perceptions of sense to the last conclusions of
ratiocination; putting a rein upon false opinion by practical rules for the conduct
of human judgment.</p>
<p>‘But these men, it may be said, were only deep thinkers, and lived in
their closets unaccustomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws
which practically regulate mankind. Gentlemen, in the place where we
now sit to administer the justice of this great country, the never-to-be-forgotten Sir Matthew Hale presided, whose faith in Christianity is an
exalted commentary upon its truth and reason, and whose life was a
glorious example of its fruits; whose justice, drawn from the pure fountain
of the Christian dispensation, will be, in all ages, a subject of the highest
reverence and admiration. But it is said by the author, that the Christian
fable is but a tale of the more ancient superstitions of the world, and may
be easily detected by a proper understanding 
<pb n="321"/>
of the mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton understand those mythologies?
Was he less versed than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of the world? No; they
were the subject of his immortal song; and though shut out from all recurrence to
them, he poured them forth from the stores of a memory rich with all that man
ever knew, and laid them in their order as the illustration of real and exalted
faith, the unquestionable source of that fervid genius, which has cast a kind of
shade upon all the other works of man: -</p>
<lg type="poem">
  <l>“He passed the flaming bounds of space and time;</l>
<l>The living throne, the sapphire blaze,</l>
<l>Where angels tremble while they gaze:</l>
<l>He saw - but blasted with excess of light,</l>
  <l>Closed his eyes in endless night,”’</l>
</lg>
<p>Let me add to this beautiful extract one word in reply to Mr. Paine. The
basis of his objection to Christianity, is the absence of all <hi rend="i">need</hi> of a
revelation, from the sufficiency of the book of creation to display the
attributes of its Author, of which book the indispensable key is
<hi rend="sc">trigonometry</hi>; a revelation for the <hi rend="sc">poor</hi>, of which the <hi rend="i">only</hi> key is
<hi rend="sc">trigonometry</hi>!!! But if they had the key, and were familiar with the
use of it, it would only aid a little their conception of the <hi rend="sc">knowledge</hi>
and <hi rend="sc">power</hi> of <hi rend="sc">God</hi>; it would avail them nothing towards the discovery
of his moral attributes. The impression of his goodness that arises from
one aspect of the material creation is shocked and confounded by
another. If a humming-bird is submitted to our examination, it is difficult to
believe that the Divine Artist of such exquisite beauty can be other than a
being 
<pb n="322"/>
of infinite benevolence; but if a scorpion is brought into contrast, it
  completely overthrows or perplexes any such positive inference.</p>

me, during my residence in Surinam, to evince the slightest evidence of his
having received any <hi rend="i">peremptory</hi> orders to carry into execution the provisions of
the treaty between the crowns of England and Holland for its suppression with
real energy and <hi rend="sc">good faith</hi>, is the <hi rend="i">present</hi> Governor, Major General de Veer,
a fine, soldierly, veteran-looking, hospitably-hearted man, distinguished for his
successful defence of Curaçoa, in the year eighteen hundred and four, against a
very formidable attack by a British force under the command of Commodore
Bligh of the Thetis. He, (General de Veer,) although differing much as an
individual from the opinions of the abolitionists, has acted like a man of the
strictest honour, and in one or two instances involved himself in considerable
hot water with the colonial magistrates by his decision and firmness, which gives
me great reason to fear that he is <hi rend="sc">not</hi> supported as he ought to be by the
ministers of <hi rend="sc">his</hi> king, for it is clear that they are bound, as well by the original
treaty, as by express promises subsequently made to His Britannic Majesty's
ambassador in Holland, (as appears by the parliamentary papers,) to send him
over orders so <hi rend="sc">peremptory</hi> for the extinction of the traffic, and <hi rend="i">approbation
so express and decisive</hi> of his energetic enforcement of the Dutch abolition laws,
that he may always shelter himself from any personal ill-will towards him of the
colonists by an appeal to them. I am the more disposed to this suspicion, from
the circumstance of there having been, at the time of my writing this note,
(January 18th, 1826,) no Dutch ship of war here since <hi rend="i">the third of last July</hi>, the
indispensability of whose employment, in the effectual suppression of slave-smug-</p>
<pb n="324"/>
<p>gling, in a colony with such a long line of sea coast and so many creeks distant
from observation as Surinam, has (it also appears by the parliamentary papers)
formed a subject of earnest representation by the British ambassador in Holland
to the Dutch ministers, who expressed their ready acquiescence, and promised
that in future the Governor of Surinam should not be unprovided with the
necessary naval assistance, - a promise however of which hitherto I have
certainly seen no effect here.</p>
